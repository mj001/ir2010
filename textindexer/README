RAM: use at least 1.5GB. Otherwise producing the ARFF will result in an exception.

There are 2 ways to use NGrams.jar.
1) Standalone app
Execute the jar file (in the directory containing the jar file do: "java -jar ngrams.jar")
Follow the instructions.

2) Use it in Java code as a Java library
Instantiate Runner and execute the only method available in Runner (run_from_dir).
It will search for files in the directory, recursively (it will resolve directories in the directory).

Runner r = new Runner();
r.run_from_dir("/root/angabe/20news-18828", "test2.arff", 4, false, 0.5, 30);
