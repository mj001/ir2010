Computing & Language Resources
Click here for the former page: Languages: Human, Computer, Government which is no longer
being maintained.
These web pages are for people interested in computers with some emphasis
on non-US/non-English applications and other topics. Links to various sites
on these topics are provided here. I'm also offering several resources of
my own creation. "C"
Program of the Month is the source code for a "C" language
computer program that I'm making freely available for personal use. No
warranty or guarantee is offered or implied. Feel free to use at your own
risk. No suggestions for improvements or feedback are sought. 
I plan to place a new program here every month.
 
 
Also, I'm providing listings of a Vietnamese-English education-related
vocabulary glossary that I've put together. Here are links to several
formats:
- Vietnamese Education Terms (VIQR text format)
- Vietnamese Education Terms (VISCII format) 
- Vietnamese Education Terms (VPS format)
- Vietnamese Education Terms (VNI format)
- Vietnamese Education Terms (VNU format)
- Vietnamese Education Terms (Dynamic font)
VietMate generates the VPS, VNI, VNU & Dynamic font encoded versions. This
glossary will be periodically expanded. You can send me suggested updates
or additions, if you have any. However, I have very limited time and will
probably not respond to requests for information.
 
These pages are dedicated to my wife, Mary, who is responsible for any
success I have achieved or will achieve in life.
