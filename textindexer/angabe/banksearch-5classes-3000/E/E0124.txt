Introduction
cdb is a machine-independent debugger for C programs compiled by lcc 4.x, a retargetable compiler for
ISO Standard C. The latest version of cdb, version 2.2 (40KB ZIP
file), differs in important ways from the implementation described in D. R. Hanson and M.
Raghavachari, "A Machine-Independent Debugger," Software&#151;Practice and
Experience 26 (11), 1277-1299, Nov. 1996 ( 
350KB).
The remainder of this page describes the differences in sections that parallel the SPE
paper. This version of cdb runs on the x86 under Windows NT 4.01 and on the Sparc under
Solaris.
Design
Most of the nub interface (defined in nub.h) remains
unchanged; in the following listing and in those below, boldface identifies the changes.
typedef struct {
	char file[32];
	unsigned short x, y;
} Nub_coord_T;
typedef struct {
	char name[32];
	Nub_coord_T src;
	char *fp;
	void *context;
} Nub_state_T;
typedef void (*Nub_callback_T)(Nub_state_T state);
extern struct module *_Nub_modules[];
extern struct sframe *_Nub_tos;
extern void _Nub_init(Nub_callback_T startup, Nub_callback_T fault);
extern void _Nub_bp(int index);
extern void _Nub_src(Nub_coord_T src,
	void apply(int i, const Nub_coord_T *src, void *cl), void *cl);
extern Nub_callback_T _Nub_set(Nub_coord_T src, Nub_callback_T onbreak);
extern Nub_callback_T _Nub_remove(Nub_coord_T src);
extern int _Nub_fetch(int space, const void *address, void *buf, int nbytes);
extern int _Nub_store(int space, void *address, const void *buf, int nbytes);
extern int _Nub_frame(int n, Nub_state_T *state);
As before, breakpoints are described by single integer indices, but the implementation
of _Nub_bp detailed below uses these indices to compute the symbol-table tail
instead of the tail being passed as the second parameter to _Nub_bp. Nub_state_Ts
remain unchanged, except for the type of the fp field, which becomes a char
pointer to simplify address computations.
Implementation
This version of cdb works only with lcc 4.x, and it requires the C Interfaces and Implementations
(CII) library.
While the nub interface changed little, the implementation changed significantly to
accommodate changes in the symbol-table format, initialization code, and frame layout. The
implementation consists of the following files.

In the two-process version, cdb is the server and the target (the program being
debugged) is the client. server.c is the server side of the RPC channel and client.c is
the client side. (These roles are reversed in Table 1 and Figure 6 in the paper.) cdb can
run on a different machine than the target, but the machines must have the same type
metrics and endianness.
The two-process version uses sockets instead of pipes.
Symbol Tables
The symbol table no longer uses "link" symbols; each module structure points
to a list of per-module, globals (including statics):
struct module {
	union scoordinate *coordinates;
	struct ssymbol **tails;
	char **files;
	struct ssymbol *globals;
	int length;
	const char *constants;
};
At start-time, all the modules are read into the symbol-table cache in the debugger so
that the globals lists can be visited as necessary during symbol-table
traversals. This design is more complicated that the original design, but it avoid
writable symbol-table entries, which permits the symbol-table entries to be stored in
read-only segments.
The coordinates and tails fields point to parallel arrays of
packed source coordinates and symbol-table tail pointers. For a module *m,
and stopping point index i, m->coordinates[i] is the source
coordinate for that stopping point and m->tails[i] points to the
corresponding symbol-table entry for the tail of the symbol table. scoordinate
structures remain unchanged from the original implementation.
Symbol-table entries are defined by
struct ssymbol {
	union {
	int value;
	int offset;
	void *address;
	} u;
	const char *name;
	const char *file;
	unsigned char scope;
	unsigned char sclass;
	struct module *module;
	const struct stype *type;
	const struct ssymbol *uplink;
};
The u field holds the value of enumeration identifiers, the frame offset
for locals and parameters, or the address of globals and statics. The frame offset
is the difference between the location of the local or parameter and the shadow stack
frame. These offsets are now computed at compile-time; they are machine-independent, but
they do depend on lcc's back-end technology, because they are lifted from structures
managed by the back ends.
The uplink fields induce an inverted tree structure as shown in Figure 7
in the paper, but this tree does not include globals and statics. The globals lists are
threaded through the uplink fields. Each symbol-table entry points to its
module structure so that the global lists can be accessed.
For each module, all symbol-table entries, strings, and types are now emitted
contiguously in a "constants" table pointed to by the constants
field in a module; the length field gives the length in bytes of this table.
This design permits the debugger to inhale the entire table the first time one of its
entries is referenced, which reduces network traffic (i.e., the number of messages) and
avoids the possibility that the table has been corrupted (which should not occur, because
the table is emitted in a read-only segment).
Breakpoints
The coordinates field in a module points to an array of scoordinate structures, defined
as in the original implementation:
union scoordinate {
 int i;
 struct { unsigned int y:16,x:10,index:5,flag:1; } le;
 struct { unsigned int flag:1,index:5,x:10,y:16; } be;
};
For stopping point n at expression e, lcc emits
 
(module.coordinates[n].i module->tails[fp->ip]. The
nub assigns this value to the context field of the Nub_state_T
value passed to the breakpoint handler.
The stadow stack frame is initialized as in the original implementation, but the
initialization is simpler; for example, upon entry to lookup in lookup.c, lcc emits only
struct sframe tos;
tos.down = _Nub_tos;
tos.name = "lookup";
tos.module = &_module__V8e0dade4;
_Nub_tos = &tos;
The frame offsets for locals and parameters are computed and emitted at compile time.
Strings like "lookup" above are stored in the constants table.
For each call expression e, lcc emits
 
(tos.ip = n, e)
where n is the stopping point number of the call. For each return e,
lcc emits
 
temp = e; _Nub_tos = tos.down; return temp;
As mentioned in the paper (bottom of page 1296), this approach requires nub-aware
versions of setjmp and longjmp that reset _Nub_tos
correctly on non-local returns. The advantage of this approach is that less nub-specific
code is generated at calls and returns.
