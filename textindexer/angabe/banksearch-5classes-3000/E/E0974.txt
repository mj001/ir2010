 For VC++ 
 Here is an example that works on MS VC++, if you use another compiler, the code will be a little different. If you use Linux/Unix, the code will be completely different. If this code doesn't work for you, you may need to tell us which compiler you are using.
 
// code to list all of the files in the current working directory
#include 
#include 
#include 
 
void main(void)
{
 struct _finddata_t c_file;
 long hFile;
 
 // Find first .c file in current directory
 if((hFile = _findfirst("*.*", &c_file)) == -1L)
 printf("No files to list.\n");
 else
 {
 printf("%-20s %.24s %9ld\n", c_file.name, ctime(&(c_file.time_write)), c_file.size);
 
 while(_findnext(hFile, &c_file) == 0)
 {
 printf("%-20s %.24s %9ld\n", c_file.name, ctime(&(c_file.time_write)), c_file.size);
 }
 
 _findclose(hFile);
 }
}
 
Happy Coding,
