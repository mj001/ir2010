A Powerful Function Parser
This article was contributed by Andreas Jaeger.
The inspiration to write this code was to have an 
easy-to-use parser for functions given as string. You have a string like 
"cos(x)-7*x/(1+x)"
and you want to compute some values, maybe for displaying 
the graph of the function. You can write code like this:
CFunction* fkt = 
 CFunction::Parse("cos(x)-7*x/(1+x)");
long double y = fkt->Execute(1.5);
There are lots of definitions in the background, but the 
result is easy and fast! There is a one-time pasing step to construct the 
function tree, and function evaluations are only calls of standard math 
functions like sin, +, *, sqrt. When you want to know details about the 
implementaion, you should look into the source code. It would be too complex to 
describe the parsing algorithm here.
