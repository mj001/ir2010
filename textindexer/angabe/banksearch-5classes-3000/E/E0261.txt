Section 7.2: Using a Class (Instantiation)
 
Just as writing a class declaration was an extension of concepts
we've already covered, the same is true of the syntax needed to
instantiate an object. Instantiating an object is what allows
you to actually use objects in your program. You can write hundreds
and hundreds of class declarations, but none of that code will be used
until you create an instance of an object. A class declaration is
merely a template for what an object should look like. When you
instantiate an object, C++ follows the class declaration as if it were
a blueprint for how to create an instance of that object.
Instantiating an object
The good news is, you already know how to create an instance of an
object! It is exactly the same as using a variable. Let's say you
want to have four players in your game, each trying to find their way
to the end of a maze faster than the others. You might start by
creating four instances of your Player object, like this:
Player blueHat;
Player redHat;
Player greenHat;
Player yellowHat;
It's as easy as that. Although these objects are all
Players, they are completely independent of one another.
They were created from the same template, but they can have different
attributes. For example, "blueHat" might be a slow, strong player,
while "greenHat" might be quick and weak, and "yellowHat" might be a
well balanced individual, etc. The thing that makes these objects
similar is that they all must have values for strength, health, and
agility, but nothing else. They can all move, attack monsters, and
get treasures, but that is all they can do. So -- they are similar in
the kinds of things they can do and the attributes they must have, but
they are different in that they can each have their own values for
those attributes.
Using an object's member functions
Now that we can create objects, we need to know how to use them. That
is, we need to be able to use their member functions. Calling an
object's member functions is similar to calling a regular function,
with a slight twist.
Suppose someone is playing your adventure game, and they are
controlling the player with the green hat. When the person hits the
key to attack a monster, you need to make sure that the correct code
gets executed so that the right player attacks the monster. The code
would look like this:
greenHat.attackMonster();
It's very similar to the way that a regular function is called,
preceeded by the name of the object on which the function should be
called (greenHat), and a period. So, instead of calling
the function attackMonster(), we are telling
greenHat to call the function attackMonster.
This is the power of C++. You can very easily "delegate
responsibility" to the objects you've written, so that what seems like
an impossible task, writing a video game, becomes much more
manageable.
Now let's suppose that greenHat picks up a treasure. Somewhere in your program, the following will get executed:
greenHat.getTreasure();
This will cause the function getTreasure to be executed for the player with the green hat only. The other players in the game will not execute this function. Perhaps you write getTreasure to look like this:
void Player::getTreasure() {
 health++; // increments the value of the player's health by one
}
Suppose that before greenHat picked up the treasure, the following were the players' values for their healths:
blueHat: 14 
redHat: 11 
yellowHat: 8 
greenHat: 11 
After greenHat picked up the treasure, the values would be:
blueHat: 14 
redHat: 11 
yellowHat: 8 
greenHat: 12 
Notice that only greenHat's health increased when the function Player::getTreasure was called; that's because the member function was called on greenHat only.
