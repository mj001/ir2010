Top Ten Excuses for Memory Leak
Excuses are like garbage cans. Everybody has one, and they all stink. Here
are the top ten used to justify "a little memory leak".
10. A little memory leak is no big thing.
Especially in a routine that's called only once, or a couple times.
Right?
No, wrong. Leaky programs tend to display wierd intermittents ten times
harder to troubleshoot than a reproducible error. It will drive the users
nuts.
9. Nobody will ever find out.
Since leaky programs usually produce intermittents that can appear to
crash in other people's programs, I can dodge the bullet by blaming it
on other programs.
Of course, a good Troubleshooter can trace the memory leak down to the
line of code. And if they find it in your code, everyone will hate you.
Not to mention that your transgression might be published on the web...
8. Complex programs always have memory leak.
Come on! Live in the real world. With today's customers demand for more
features, real-world apps are too complex to elimate every memory leak.
Don't write apps exceeding your abilities as a programmer. Instead,
craft your app from a collection of encapsulated and independent
classes, each of which can be tested and de-leaked independently.
7. My Application Framework is too entangled.
My application framework gives me over 100,000 lines of code already
programmed. Everybody's using it. Unfortunately, it's not modular enough
to independently test classes.
Users won't forgive your bugs because of your choice of application
framework any more than you'd forgive your housepainters sloppy work because
he chose a bad sprayer. Gone are the days when your only choices were MFC,
OWL, and DOITYOURSELF. Borland's C++ Builder is based on Ultra-Modular
VCL. Powersoft's C++ product also shows promise.
If you're afraid to switch application frameworks because you want the
one made in Redmond, beware. They won't blame the guys in Redmond for your
bugs, they'll blame you. And a competitor with solid code will eat your
lunch.
6. The memory leak is in the operating system.
My customers demand apps that work with the most popular operating system,
and the leaks occur in that operating system.
Leaks in the OS? Maybe that's true and maybe it isn't. The only way
to find out is a complete analysis of your program and classes. And that's
only possible with a modularly crafted app. If you do prove a leak is in
the OS, it's your job as a programmer to work around it.
5. The memory leak is in my third party tools.
I can't write everything from scratch. I can't re-invent the wheel.
This is the real world. And some of those third party tools have memory
leaks. What can I do?
You can demand better of your third party vendors. Demand that their
offerings come in distinct, modular, and independent classes. Then test
each class for memory leak. Don't have the time? Then pay the price in
the marketplace.
4. Product development cycles are too fast.
Be real. This is 1997. The marketplace demands a four month time-to-market.
There's no time to test thoroughly or build in quality.
OK, fine. Kick the product out the door in four months, with memory
leaks (and the resulting other problems). Now start your next 4 month production
cycle. With huge volumes of trouble calls yanking your programmers away
from their work. And trade magazines demanding explanations for the bugs.
And decreased revenue from the tarnished reputation.
3. It's hard to get good programmers today.
As soon as I get a good programmer, someone else offers him more money.
The minute I train a programmer, he goes somewhere else. The team at the
start of a project bears no resemblance to the team at the end of the project.
So there are bugs.
If you have problems paying for good talent now, imagine how tough it
will be when your revenue stream dries up from buggy product. Give your
good programmers large raises commensurate with their willingness to accept
training in modular and independent class construction and use. Those large
raises are nothing next to what you'll have to pay a new guy.
2. Leaks and bugs are the price you pay for GUI.
Take your head out of the clouds. Today's user demands GUI, and GUI
always has memory leaks. Get real!
See Excuse #1.
1. Everything else leaks, why shouldn't mine?
Almost all software today has memory leaks, and people still buy it.
Why should I spend money on something that won't influence the buying decision?
Read the trades. Today's corporate managers are sick and tired of the
high cost of ownership, and are investigating possible solutions. One of
those proposed solutions, the Java enabled Network PC, would put a lot
of people, including our favorite operating system, out of business. Many
lament the fact that in many industries, all this automation has brought
almost no increase in productivity. Our economy can't continue to support
buggy software. Changes are coming. And when they do, memory leaks will
not be forgiven.
How to Eliminate Memory Leak
Make everything modular and independent.
It's been known since the 70's. The less modular your program, the more
problems. In the 70's, subroutines with global variables provided adequate
modularity. With the more sophisticated apps of the 80's, local variables
were required. Now in the 90's, variables and subroutines are packaged
together in classes, and with a few exceptions each class should NOT be
required to know about the other classes. Without this level of modularity,
you'll find it hard to write a sophisticated app, and almost impossible
to completely debug it. This is the source of most of the "it'llhavetodoware"
of today. Before taking the next steps to eliminate memory leaks, try your
best to craft your app from encapsulated and independent classes.
How to easily delete everything you create
Make a Zap() command
I define a zap() command like this:
#define zap(x) if(x){delete(x); x=0;}
Then, assuming all pointers start their lives as null pointers, I can safely
delete what's been newed, and not delete things that haven't been newed,
with a series of zap() commands like this:
zap(pchFirstname);
zap(pchLastname);
zap(pchJobDescription);
There is nothing magical about this, it just saves repetative code and
makes it more readable. Do not stick a typecast in the zap() command --
if something errors out on the above zap() command it likely has another
error somewhere.
One more note. Stroustrup says in his C++ book that #define macros are
obsolete in C++. For the most part I agree with him, but this macro really
is just a substitute for lines of code, so I think it's the best way to
do it. If you know a better way, please write
me.
Class member variable pointers
Generally speaking, most heap-allocated objects start their lives as pointers
in the private part of classes. Chances are they're allocated with a new
command in that classes constructor. Make a class method called deallocate()
to use the delete command on every heap-allocated class variable.
I like to make sure the object was really allocated, so I make sure
the pointers start their lives as null. Then I make deallocate() a series
of zap() commands. My deallocate() method then contains
code like:
zap(pchFirstname);
zap(pchLastname);
zap(pmyobject);
Of course, my destructor will call deallocate(), as well as any ABEND method.
Deleting member variable pointers in a loop
Sometimes the pointer isn't new'ed in the constructor, but in a method
that can be called over and over. A good example is a string-constructing
method which allocates memory sufficient to hold the finished string. For
instance:
void MYCLASS::makeFilename(const char *szName, const char *szDir)
 {
 pchMemberDir = new char[strlen(szName]+strlen(szDir)+2]; //strlens plus backslash plus null
 //*** DO THE STRCPY() AND STRCAT() COMMANDS HERE ***
 }
The if the method above is called 1000 times in a loop, you'll end up with
one valid char pointer and 999 disembodied memory chuncks. The trick is
to put the following line of code just before the new command:
zap(pchMemberDir) //if exists from past call, delete it
Test your classes.
Here's the code. The explanation follows the code:
void testMyclassOnce()
 {
 MYCLASS myobject;
 //*** EXERCISE ALL METHODS BELOW ***
 //*** COMMENT IN THE NEXT AS LEAKS ARE ELIMINATED FROM PREVIOUS ***
 //myobject.method1();
 //myobject.method2();
 //myobject.method3();
 }
const int testMyclass(const int nReps)
 {
 int nLeaks = 0;
 long lMemLast = 0;
 long lMemOrg=0;
 long lMem;
 for(int nT = 0; nT freeze(0); //WITHOUT THIS, YOU HAVE A MEMORY LEAK
 }
void main()
 {
 cout freeze(0), which "unfreezes" the string
and allows it to be destroyed along with the ostrstring object.
How about when the string is returned by the function. Obviously the
function can't destroy it. In such a case, you have to destroy it yourself:
const char *makeFilename(const char *szName, const char *szDir)
 {
 ostrstream ost;
 ost freeze(0).
Unfortunately, this would expose the returned string to use by another
memory allocation, which would overwrite the string and produce self-modifying
code. Note also your calling function can't forget to get the pointer,
then deallocate it with a call to the next:
