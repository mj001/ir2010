Switch on Strings in C++ 
This article was contributed by Stefan Ruck.
Environment: This is standard C++. So you do not need any special environment.
 
Preface
How many times have you written code like this: 
if (!strcmp(pszValue, "Value X"))
 DoThis();
else if (!strcmp(pszValue, "Value Y"))
 DoThat();
else if (!strcmp(pszValue, "Value Z"))
 DoSomethingElse();
else
 DontKnowWhatToDo();
Too many! And those of you who had the chance to take a look 
at C# might think 'Why can't I code something similar in C++ like this: 
switch(strValue)
{
 case "Value X":
 DoThis();
 break;
 case "Value Y":
 DoThat();
 break;
 case "Value Z";
 DoSomethingElse();
 break;
 default:
 DontKnowWhatToDo();
 break;
}
(This code is legal C#. You can switch on strings in C#.) 
In this article I will show you a way to implement a switch on 
strings using pure standard C++. 
The Bad News
I can't give you a solution to do exactly what you can do in C#. 
The Good News
The Standard Template Library (STL), part of the ANSI/ISO 
C++ Standard, offers everything needed to get really close to the C# sample. 
The solution is very simple. You need an enumeration and a std::map, 
and that's it. The enumeration defines the numeric values use in the 
switch statement. The std::map contains the link between the valid 
string values you want to compare some runtime data against, and the numeric enum 
values you can make a switch on. The string is the key of the map, the 
enumerator the value. 
Here We Go
After thinking about the problem a little bit, there is only 
one place where to put the enum definition and the std::map 
definition: The .cpp file. Both, the enum and the std::map, 
should be declared as static to make them visible only to the code of this 
particular .cpp file, which helps to avoid global namespace pollution (for more 
on this see John Lakos, Large Scale C++ Software Design, Addison-Wesley). There 
is no need to declare them as members of any class since normally the connection 
between a string value and the action to be taken is very specific to the 
respective code. 
And here comes a sample Switch On String implementation I will use for later 
discussion: 
#include 
#include 
#include 
// Value-Defintions of the different String values
static enum StringValue { evNotDefined, 
 evStringValue1, 
 evStringValue2, 
 evStringValue3, 
 evEnd };
// Map to associate the strings with the enum values
static std::map s_mapStringValues;
// User input
static char szInput[_MAX_PATH];
// Intialization
static void Initialize();
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
 // Init the string map
 Initialize();
 // Loop until the user stops the program
 while(1)
 {
 // Get the user's input
 cout
