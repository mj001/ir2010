fgets-Get a string from a level 2 file
Synopsis
 #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
 p = fgets(buffer,length,fp);
 char *p; /* buffer pointer or NULL */
 char *buffer; /* buffer pointer */
 int length; /* buffer length in bytes */
 FILE *fp; /* file pointer */
Description
 The fgets function gets a string from the specified level 2 file,
 which must have been previously opened for input. Characters are
 copied from the file to the buffer until a new line (n) has been
 copied, or length-1 characters have been copied, or the
 end-of-file is hit. In any case, if the read succeeds, the buffer
 is terminated with a trailing null byte (0). If the read fails,
 the buffer will not be modified.
Returns
 If the end-of-file is hit before any bytes are read, a NULL
 pointer is returned. If an I/O error occurs, a NULL pointer is
 returned and additional information is placed in the external
 integers errno . If no I/O error occurs and at least
 one byte was read from the file, the buffer argument is returned.
Example
 /* Assume that stdin contains the following lines: */
 /* */
 /* Hello, folks! */
 /* Goodbye, folks! */
 #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
 void main(void)
 {
 char *p,b[80];
 /* For the next two lines, p will point to b */
 p = fgets(b,sizeof(b),stdin);
 printf("b = %p, %sp = %pn", b, b, p);
 /* b contains "Hello, folks!" */
 p = fgets(b,sizeof(b),stdin);
 printf("b = %p, %sp = %pn", b, b, p);
 /* b now contains "Goodbye, folks!n" */
 p = fgets(b,sizeof(b),stdin);
 printf("b = %p, %sp = %pn", b, b, p);
 }
