Alan Balmer is the 
 owner of Balmer Consulting, and is a veteran of over 20 years of 
 experience in all aspects of computing; from mainframes to microcomputers, 
 from design to debugging. His undergraduate work was 
 in physics and theoretical math, with a minor in chemistry, and 
 he has spent time as a logic circuit designer, electronics engineer 
 and NIR spectroscopy researcher, with an interesting but not 
 habit-forming excursion into management. He has been a member of 
 Team Powersoft, then Team Sybase, since the Compuserve days. His 
 software career began by writing circuit design programs in Fortran 
 and progressed to work on real-time process control operating 
 systems. He is (or has been) reasonably fluent in several 
 assembler languages, C, C++, Perl, Java, FORTRAN, BASIC, PASCAL, 
 and PL/I, and now thinks Python is neat. Al is now based in 
 Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and does a variety of things, from small business 
 consulting to writing device drivers for process 
 control, but spends the majority of his time writing C on Unix 
 systems for a manufacturer of card-based transaction and security 
 systems. Al enjoys writing tools and though interested in everything, 
 will likely concentrate on the Watcom auxiliary programs, 
 leaving the heavy-duty compiler work to younger and smarter 
 colleagues. You can contact Alan via email at 
 alan.balmer@teamsybase.com.

Craig is now a closet developer as he has 
 taken on a CEO role at Action Engine (http://www.actionengine.com). 
 He worked at Watcom from 1989 to 1993, on versions 8.0 through 
 9.5. He was reponsible for developing the Windows extender 
 (win386), the editor, the win16/win32/win386/os2 2 debuggers, the 
 win16/win32 runtime libraries and various and sundry other things 
 before moving to Microsoft in 1993. While at Microsoft, Craig was 
 the founding developer for the DirectX project, and left in 
 January of 2000 after spending almost 2 years as the General 
 Manager of the Windows Media Platform group. Craig is 
 still in Redmond, WA, having a blast doing the startup thing, and 
 among other things is doing programming for the Palm OS where his 
 16 bit, low memory, slow processor experience is finally paying 
 off. After all this time, Craig still secretly wishes he was 
 playing poker with his Watcom buddies again. You can contact Craig 
 at craig@theeislers.com.

Stephen has 
 been programming in C since 1985, C++ since 1996 
 and assembler since sometime in the dark distant past, 
 mostly on Microsoft Operating Systems. Stephen has used every 
 version of Watcom C/C++ since 1987 (version 7.0), and has also 
 used just about every version of Microsoft C, C++ BASIC 
 compilers since 1984. Stephen has been a member of TeamSybase, the 
 official Sybase support team for the Sybase News Server since 
 1996, supporting Watcom C/C++ and more recently Watcom Fortran. 
 Stephen has good knowledge on 16 and 32-bit DOS, 16 and 
 32-bit Windows and as part of he Open Watcom group expects to 
 be looking at the C, C++ and Fortran compilers as well as WASM and 
 the C, C++ and Fortran runtime libraries. Stephen maintains 
 good relationships with the original developers of the Watcom 
 compilers in Waterloo. You can contact Stephen via email at

Timur Tabi is the world's sexiest 
 OS/2 developer. When he's not modeling men's underwear for 
 Victoria's Secret, he writes OS/2 and Linux device drivers. 
 Timur's list of accomplishments, both with and without his clothes 
 on, are too numerous to include here, but you can get an idea of 
 just how studly he is by visiting his web site at http://www.tabi.org/timur/index.html. As 
 a member of the Open Watcom group, Timur will be concentrating on 
 enhancing the OS/2-specific areas of the compiler, but will probably 
 end up working on whatever catches his fancy at the moment. 
 You can contact Timur via email at timur@tabi.org.

Jason Quijano is a Chico State 
 Computer Science student learning how to be a "real” programmer from 
 Kendall. ( see above ) . Jason likes to read Willam S. Burroughs, Jack 
 Kerouac and Alen Ginsberg. He recalls Burroughs saying , "I have an 
 exercise I learned from a Mafia Don in Ohio: see everybody on the street 
 before they see you. It's quite interesting actually because, if you see 
 everyone before they see you, they won't see you. And then you'll find 
 that somebody beat you." You can contact Jason via email at 
 jasonq@scitechsoft.com.
