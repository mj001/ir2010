Errata for 1st/11th printing of The C++ Programming Language
Errata for
Bjarne Stroustrup:
The C++ Programming Language (special edition),
Addison-Wesley, 2000. ISBN0-201-70073-5.
Errata for the 1st printing yielding the 3rd printing.
Also for the 11th printing of "The C++ Programming Language (3rd edition)"
yielding the 12th printing.
Errors and Clarifications
Chapter 3:
pg 55	s/Entry& e =/const Entry& e =/
Chapter 4:
pg 76	A better version of the example:
#include 
#include 
int main()
{
	std::cout ::max()
	::is_signed 
Chapter 6:
pg 131	Clarification of the first paragraph after the first example:
	"The T(e) construct is sometimes referred to as a function-style
	cast. Unfortunately, for a built-in type T, T(e) is equivalent to
	(T)e (6.2.7). This implies that for many built-in types T(e)
	is not safe. ..."
Chapter 7:
pg 146	s/21.2.1/21.3.2/
Chapter 8:
pg 193	add "++Driver::no_of_errors;" to each catch clause
Chapter 10:
pg 258	s/10.4.6.1/10.4.6.2/
Chapter 11:
pg 280	add the sentence "Scopes outside the innermost enclosing namespace
	scope are not considered." before the first "For example:" and
	replace the first example by:
class AE { /* ... */ };	// not a friend of Y
namespace N {
	class X { /* ... */ };	// Y's friend
	class Y {
	friend class X;
	friend class Z;
	friend class AE;
	};
	class Z { /* ... */ };	// Y's friend
}
pg 288	s/return b;/return f;/
Chapter 13:
pg 346	s/}/};/ twice in the first example
Chapter 16:
pg 433	s/s.18.7/D.4.4.1/ on the line for 
pg 457	s/vector tmp/vector/
Chapter 17:
pg 485	s/value_type;/value_type,/
pg 496	s/size_t/ptrdiff_t/	twice
pg 496	add after the definition of c_array:
	"For compatibility with arrays, I use the signed ptrdiff_t (16.1.2)
	rather than the unsigned size_t as the subscript type.
	Using size_t could lead to subtle ambiguities when using []
	on a c_array."
Chapter 18:
pg 535	s/sort(off.begin(),off.end(),Person_lt)/off.sort(off,Person_lt)/
pg 536	/class located_in {/class located_in : public unary_function {
pg 536	s/output_iterator/ostream_iterator/
Chapter 20:
pg 591	replace the first sentence by
	"When a position and a size are supplied for a string in a compare(),
	only the indicated substring is used. For example, s.compare(pos,n,s2)
	is equivalent to string(s,pos,n).compare(s2)."
Chapter 21:
pg 619	somewhere add "If a get() or getline() function doesn't read
	and remove at least one character from the stream, setstate(failbit)
	is called, so that subsequent reads from the stream will fail (or
	an exception is thrown (21.3.6))." also modify the example to:
	void subtle_error()
	{
	char buf[256];
	while (cin) {
	cin.get(buf,256);	// read a line
	cout 
pg 632	s/noskipws()/unsetf(ios_base::skipws)/ twice
pg 646	s/eptr/egptr/ twice
Chapter 22:
pg 670 see a complete example of Slice_iter and matrix
	for a better idea of what the errata adds up to.
pg 669	s/int i/size_t i/
pg 671	the last example used a non-standard feature. Better:
	v_even *= v_odd;	// multiply element pairs and store results in even elements
	v_odd = 0;	// assign 0 to every odd element of d
pg 674	s/int i/size_t i/ twice
pg 683	a better operator*():
valarray operator*(const Matrix& m, valarray& v)
{
	valarray res(m.dim2());
	for (size_t i = 0; i& ri = m.row(i);
	res[i] = inner_product(ri,ri.end(),&v[0],double(0));
	}
	return res;
}
pg 684	a better operator*():
valarray operator*(valarray& v, const Matrix& m)
{
	valarray res(m.dim1());
	for (size_t i = 0; i& ci = m.column(i);
	res[i] = inner_product(ci,ci.end(),&v[0],double(0));
	}
	return res;
}
