Tutorials Section Contents
 
This area will contain various learning infos on C++ and 
 game programming. If you have any questions about programming in Pascal(DOS) 
 or C++(DOS or Windows), feel free to contact me. 
 For other pages related to programming topics, see my links 
 page. The information in these tutorials is not a replacement for 
 a good book and/or teacher since I can only put as much information my 
 spare time and experience allows me, but it will be a good start.

Download This Section
 
This section is now available for download. Just unzip 
 to a new directory. I ask that you don't distribute this on your site 
 or link directly to the file, instead you may link to the main page. This 
 is so I can keep a single official copy on the net.

Beginning Programming
 
This area of programming is best taught by a large book 
 and hopefully a good teacher. If you are completely new to programming 
 I suggest trying to learn a language like Visual BASIC or Pascal. Below 
 is a link to a site which has a tutorial on QBASIC, which is an old BASIC 
 interpreter which Microsoft always included with DOS and on the Windows 
 CD for free.
 
QBASIC 
 Programming Tutorial -- from the same author of "A Programming Resource Megasite," 
 an OK tutorial for beginning programmers. The Megasite probably has links 
 to more and better beginning tutorials.
 
Learning C/C++ without classes
 
This tutorial requires some programming skills from any 
 other language, espically BASIC or Pascal, since this will only explain 
 working with the language C/C++, not programming in general.

Learning Allegro
 
This tutorial requires C programming skills (as provided 
 above). It also has a tutorial for using MSVC with Allegro step-by-step 
 that assumes no previous MSVC knowledge.

Learning Object Oriented Programming in C++
 
This tutorial requires good C++ skills (as provided above).
 
Tutorial here, last updated 1/24/00
 The first five chapters are done, the sixth is unfinished.
 
Addendum to Learning OOP in C++
 
Some important things to realize about the previous tutorial, 
 and explains the changes that have occurred due to the new ISO C++ 98 
 standard, which is very standard now but was very new and not supported 
 when I wrote most of the tutorial in 99.
 
Discusses namespaces and the new include files, iostreams, 
 and the STL.

Appendices
 
Appendix A -- Escape Characters
 Appendix B -- ios manipulators used with 
 the 
 IntClass.cc -- constructors, = operators, 
 when data is copied. v1. 12/9/98. Finished.
 
* means the file is fully commented (sometimes line-by-line) 
 and explained.

Copy2.zip 
 -- Demonstrates file I/O with fstreams. Acts like DOS's copy command. 
 Size: 76k Last updated: 3/30/99
 
Copies 2 files like DOS copy command, but unfortunately, 
 it doesn't accept wildcards. It's just a basic program demonstrating how 
 to read and write using fstreams. Note that this program will only work 
 in DJGPP and not Borland C++ because the ANSI C++ doesn't have a standard 
 for file I/O. I found that out the hard way!
 
Changes since 10/98:
 Bugs of "overcoping" now fixed, uses new operator now.
 Fully commented line by line and explained.

IntClass.cc 
 -- constructors, = operators, when data is copied. v1. 12/9/98.
 
This example program shows how to define constructors 
 for copying, and how to define overloaded = operators, and when each is 
 used. Also shows how many copies are made. (More made than one normally 
 sees)
