strtok-Get a token
Synopsis
 #include &#060;string.h&#062;
 t = strtok(s,b);
 char *t; /* token pointer */
 char *s; /* input string pointer or NULL */
 const char *b; /* break character string pointer */
Description
 This function treats the input string as a series of one or more
 tokens separated by one or more characters from the break string.
 By making a sequence of calls to the strtok function, you can
 obtain the tokens in left-to-right order. To get the first
 (leftmost) token, supply a non-NULL pointer for the s argument.
 To get the next tokens, call the function repeatedly with a NULL
 pointer for the s argument, until you get a NULL return pointer to
 indicate that there are no more tokens. The break string can be
 changed from one call to another.
 Each time it is entered, the strtok function takes the following
 steps:
 · If the input string is NULL, the strtok function gets the
 string pointer that was used on the preceding call.
 Otherwise, it uses the new input string pointer.
 · The strtok function scans forward through the string to the
 next nonbreak character. If it is a NULL byte, the
strtok
 function returns a value of NULL to indicate that there are
 no more tokens.
 · The strtok function scans forward through the string to the
 next break character or the NULL terminator byte. In the
 former case, it writes a NULL byte into the string to
 terminate the token, and then scans forward until the next
 nonbreak character is found. In either case, it saves the
 final value of the string pointer for the next call and
 returns the token pointer.
 The input string gets changed as the scan progresses.
 Specifically, a NULL byte is written at the end of each token.
Returns
 A NULL pointer is returned when there are no more tokens.
Example
 /*
 * This example breaks out words that are separated
 * by blanks or commas. The token pointer takes on
 * the following values as the program loops:
 *
 * LOOP TOKEN
 * 1 "first"
 * 2 "second"
 * 3 "third"
 * 4 "fourth"
 * 5 NULL
 */
 #include &#060;string.h&#062;
 #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
 char test[] = "first, second third, fourth";
 void main(void)
 {
 char *token;
 token = strtok(test,", ");
 while(token != NULL)
 {
 printf("%sn",token);
 token = strtok(NULL,", ");
 }
 }
