 Stephen 
 Howe - Core Developer: Stephen has been programming 
 in C since 1985, C++ since 1996 and assembler since sometime 
 in the dark distant past, mostly on Microsoft Operating 
 Systems. Stephen has used every version of Watcom C/C++ 
 since 1987 (version 7.0), and has also used just about 
 every version of Microsoft C, C++ BASIC compilers since 
 1984. Stephen has been a member of TeamSybase, the official 
 Sybase support team for the Sybase News Server since 1996, 
 supporting Watcom C/C++ and more recently Watcom Fortran. 
 Stephen has good knowledge on 16 and 32-bit DOS, 16 and 
 32-bit Windows and as part of he Open Watcom group expects 
 to be looking at the C, C++ and Fortran compilers as well 
 as WASM and the C, C++ and Fortran runtime libraries. 
 Stephen maintains good relationships with the original 
 developers of the Watcom compilers in Waterloo. You can 
 contact Stephen via email at stephen.howe@teamsybase.com. 
 
 
 
 
 Craig Eisler - Closet Developer: Craig is now a 
 closet developer as he has taken on a CEO role at Action 
 Engine (http://www.actionengine.com). 
 He worked at Watcom from 1989 to 1993, on versions 8.0 
 through 9.5. He was reponsible for developing the Windows 
 extender (win386), the editor, the win16/win32/win386/os2 
 2 debuggers, the win16/win32 runtime libraries and various 
 and sundry other things before moving to Microsoft in 
 1993. While at Microsoft, Craig was the founding developer 
 for the DirectX project, and left in January of 2000 after 
 spending almost 2 years as the General Manager of the 
 Windows Media Platform group. Craig is still in Redmond, 
 WA, having a blast doing the startup thing, and among 
 other things is doing programming for the Palm OS where 
 his 16 bit, low memory, slow processor experience is finally 
 paying off. After all this time, Craig still secretly 
 wishes he was playing poker with his Watcom buddies again. 
 You can contact Craig at craig@theeislers.com. 
 
 
 
 Dmitry Mityugov - Core Developer: Dmitry has used 
 Watcom C/C++ for NetWare development since 1994. More
