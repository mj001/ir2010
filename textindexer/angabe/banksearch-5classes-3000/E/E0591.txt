Microsoft Mastering Series
Developers are required to move faster than ever these days to incorporate new technologies and tools into their solutions. Training tools, such as the Microsoft Mastering Series, deliver the technology and information developers need to extend today’s applications to incorporate client/server and Internet technologies. Microsoft Mastering Series is a line of professional-level, content-rich, interactive training CD-ROM products that take advanced learning out of the classroom and into the real world. Each title in the Series delivers over 40 hours of professional-level instruction, to help developers jump-start their expertise in the new features and technologies included in Microsoft Visual Studio.
Mastering Series titles are designed to be a multimedia learning experience, incorporating sound, video, and animation throughout. All Mastering titles include interactive lessons, narrated demonstrations and animations, labs, self-check questions, sample code, expert tips and techniques, and a library of valuable reference materials that supplement the lessons and exercises. A flexible browsing and searching system lets developers navigate directly to articles, white papers, and other resources relevant to the task at hand.
Developers can either use the tools in each Microsoft Mastering Series title to follow a linear course which will take them step-by-step through the key concepts and methods, or they can select specific topics and focus on what they want to learn, when they want to learn it. This means developers can use Mastering Series titles not just for training, but also to solve time-critical problems. Whatever approach a developer takes, completing a Microsoft Mastering Series self-paced course will give developers the training they need to successfully master challenging application development projects.
For developers who are looking for classroom based training, the Mastering Series titles are the basis for the courses taught by Microsoft Solution Provider and Authorized Technical Education Centers (ATECS). By using the Mastering Series Training, developers can also prepare themselves for Microsoft Solution Developer certification, which demonstrates a developer's expertise to their clients and customers.
The Mastering Series is designed for experienced developers, not beginners. Content in each title is designed to build on a base of expertise in Windows-based programming.
Mastering Series courses cover all the hot topics from building basic Windows-based applications all the way to creating client/server solutions incorporating the latest Internet and COM technologies. Titles in the series include:
- Mastering Microsoft Office 97 Development
- Mastering Visual Basic Fundamentals
- Mastering Visual Basic 6.0 Development
- Mastering Enterprise Development Using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
- Mastering MFC using Microsoft Visual C++ Fundamentals 
- Mastering MFC using Microsoft Visual C++ Development
