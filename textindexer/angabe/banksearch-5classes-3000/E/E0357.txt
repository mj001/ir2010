 setlocale()
 
 
setlocale-Set locale information for a program
Synopsis
 #include &#060;locale.h&#062;
 ret = setlocale(category, locale);
 char *ret; /* Pointer to the selected locale portion */
 int category; /* Names the portion of the locale to be
*/
 /* selected */
 const char *locale; /* Identifies the type of environment */
Description
 This function selects the appropriate portion of the program's
 locale as specified by the category and locale arguments. The
 category argument indicates which portion of a program's locale
 will be affected. You must specify one of the following values:
 Value Portion Affected
 ----- ----------------
 LC_COLLATE the behavior of the strcoll and strxfrm 
functions
 LC_CTYPE the character-handling and multibyte functions
 LC_NUMERIC the decimal point character for the formatted
I/O
 and string conversion functions, and the
 nonmonetary formatting information returned by the
 localeconv function
 LC_TIME the behavior of the strftime function
 LC_MONETARY the monetary formatting information returned by
 the localeconv function
 LC_ALL the entire program's locale
 The locale string, which identifies the type of environment to
 use, may contain one of three special values:
 Value Meaning
 ----- -------
 C Use the minimal environment for C translation.
 "" Use the Amiga native environment.
 NULL Use the current default locale without changing it.
 If the locale argument is not one of these strings, the setlocale
 function searches its internal list of locale environments for a
 matching one. If it finds one, it uses it. Otherwise, it attempts
 to open a disk-based locale specification by using the readlocale 
 function.
Returns
 If it finds the selected environment, the setlocale function
 returns a pointer to a string associated with the requested
 category. If it cannot find the environment, it returns a NULL
 pointer, and the program's locale is not changed. This string is
 considered read-only and is valid until the next call to the
 setlocale function.
