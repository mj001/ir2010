3/8 -- The Windows port 
 of MUUDPIC using MSVC and MFC has been (nearly) completed. This version 
 works much better than the original DOS or Linux versions. Its only error 
 at the moment is that it allows duplicate filenames when it should not 
 and does not ping the clients from time to time to see if they are still 
 active. The Dos box under Windows version has been discontinued and removed 
 since it doesn't work nor ever will. The Linux version is also discontinued 
 and will not work with the Windows one since I updated the protocol to 
 make it more reliable and flexible.
 
10/11 -- The Linux port of MUUDPIC has 
 been released. It would be totally completed except for some curses stuff. 
 Actually my opinion of ncurses is not too great right now, and if anyone 
 would please help, I would appreciate it. I spent 5 minutes (quite literally) 
 porting my logic to Linux, and I've spent over 10-15 hours+ porting only 
 50 lines of code! Curses seems impossible! For some reason, it doesn't 
 show right on VT100, crashes an xterm, corrupts the screen in ANSI, but 
 corrupts it just slightly less in ANSI.SYS mode. What a wonderful piece 
 of crap.

What is MUUDPIC?
 
MUUDPIC stands for Multi-User UDP Internet Chat. The purpose 
 of the project is to create an experimental networking method which will 
 be used in the multiplayer code for Project V2143: The Price of Justice. 
 The server/client pair will act almost in an identical way in the chat 
 as they would in the game, and the server will be useable in the PV2143 
 code with only a few minor adjustments. More info is available in this 
 document, or in this readme.

The TextGUI
 
The windowing library which was used in 
 DOS/Linux MUUDPIC is available as a completely separate and usable package, 
 and includes the classes CWindow text window and the CWindow based CTextBox 
 input window designed for multitasking. This libraries work under any 
 operating system and in any compiler which can make DOS/console targets 
 and has a conio.h similar to DJGPP's. I would assume this works for Borland, 
 and possibly for VC++, but I am only supporting it offically for DJGPP.
 
The Windows are easy to use with just the 
 insertion operator. Commands are simple. Set up the window and use commands 
 like: MyWin Download TextGUI
 
Information is available in this section or in the readme file.
 
Standalone library. Source ready to compile 
 for use available here (13k) along with example code. There is 
 no binary since it is only a library (the example application will compile 
 to an EXE though). Most of the TextGUI library is commented line-by-line.
