Guide: Porting 16-bit Applications to DJGPP 
Introduction
This chapter will describe some of the steps programmers face when
porting their 16-bit DOS applications to DJGPP. In this chapter I will
cover the following: 
- Compiler Specific Issues (Far memory, memory models, pointers)
- Physical Ram vs. Linear Ram
- Interrupts
- Memory Layout (effects on physical ram and DMA)
- Writing assembly routines for us TASM/MASM users
I will also assume the following of you, and your
program(s):
- Your programs follow ANSI-C standards as closely as possible
- Your programs actually work under 16-bit systems
- You have the bare bone knowledge of how 32-bit programs work
- You have access to the full DJGPP package, as well as
 NASM (Netwide Assembler
 Project)
- You have patience, and will post questions to me if you don't
 understand.
I do suggest that if you are new to 32-bit C compilers, that you read
the section on Runtime Basics. 
 If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions, feel free to
contact the author of this section, Tom St Denis, via email: tomstdenis@goplay.com
Compiler Specific
Far Memory. If you don't know what Far Memory is I
suggest that you don't read this chapter, as it is assumed you know what
this is already. If you feel adventerous I will describe it anyways.
Far Memory, on 80x86 systems anyways, is memory that is available to
the program, via segments and offsets. This means it
requires a 32-bit pointer (16 bits for the segment, 16 bits for the offset) to
access the ram. Near Memory is defined as memory that can be
accessed with only a offset. This section covers the difference between
the far and near memory. Now in a 16-bit environment we would use
far memory to get access to more then 64kb. This is quite usefull as 16-bit
applications may use upto 1MB of ram. However we don't have
this problem in DJGPP, where it is a 32-bit environment. DJGPP's memory
model is similar to tiny model in 16-bit compilers, where
there is no far memory, and only offsets are used.
However in DJGPP we do not have the 64KB limit, so this poses no problem. Since DJGPP uses
32-bit offsets (instead of 16-bit offsets), we can
access 4GB of ram with DJGPP. This is to say the
pointers in DJGPP are 32-bits and contain only a offset part.
Now that you understand the previous paragraph, porting your far
model code, is just like porting it to tiny model. Here are some
simple steps:
- Convert all far pointers to pointers of unspecified type
(essentially a near pointer). For Example:
void main(void)
{
 int far *a;
 char far *b;
 void far *c;
}
to:
void main(void)
{
 int *a;
 char *b;
 void *c;
}
- Convert all memory functions with far as the first
three letters to their respective tiny model calls.
void main(void)
{
 void far *b = farcalloc(10000, 1);
 farfree(b);
}
to: 
void main(void)
{
 void *b = calloc(10000, 1);
 free(b);
}
- Remove far before each of your functions.
void far test(void);
void far test2(void);
to: 
void test(void);
void test2(void);
Another thing when porting far model ASM code to DJGPP (among
other things) is to make sure you don't load the segment registers
with anything. Just load the offset you want to use. Although it's
worth noting that you should re-write all of your
inline assembly and external assembly code so that you
can take in account all the differences, between the two environments. 
Just to remind you, although you are in a tiny memory model you are not
restricted to 64KB. So don't worry about allocating more
then 64KB at a time. 
One last compiler specific issue. DJGPP does not support the
Intel\Borland style of inline assembly. DJGPP has a more powerful
inline assembly routines, more details can be found 
here. However later in this chapter, I discuss how to write assembly
routines with NASM (intel style assembler), so that users of TASM or MASM do
not have to learn the AT&T style assembler.
Physical Addressing vs. Linear Addressing
Memory Addresses are very different in DJGPP then in
16-bit real mode. This is probably the most worth noting when writting
graphics code, that must write to a physical address. In a
16-bit environment you could access the VGA ram (0xA000:0000) with: 
void main(void)
{
 void far *scr = (void far *) 0xA0000000L;
 scr[0] = 4;
}
Where this would put a red pixel in the top-right of the screen. However
in DJGPP this would not work. First off, it wouldn't work because the
32-bit address (physical) of the VGA screen is 0xA0000 not 0xA0000000.
It won't work for a second reason... 
Linear adressing is what we call the CPU mode when
addresses are no longer physical. Now this may seem like a
silly thing to do but, using linear addresses has many features. First
off you get to use paging
(aka Virtual Memory), and second, you can map physical ram
to any address. Linear addressing does have one drawback, it won't let you
to use physical addresses as addresses (in DJGPP) because they no longer
map to where you think they will. So using 0xA0000 as a address will
not work. Some DOS extenders will allow you to use what is
called a negative address, however DJGPP does
not support this directly. 
So how do you do it then? Good question, two different answers. 
Enable 4GB near pointers, allowing you do use
negative addressing, This method is ok, if your code is
100% bug free as this removes memory protection from DJGPP, The
best way to explain this is with a code snipet: 
#include 
void
main(void)
{
 char *screen;
 if (__djgpp_nearptr_enable() == 0) return ERROR; /* could happen */
 screen = 0xa0000 + __djgpp_conventional_base; 
 screen[0] = 4;
 __djgpp_nearptr_disable();
}
This example plots a red pixel in the top right hand corner of the screen.
Now there are some problems with this method. After you call any DPMI
specific routine (which includes allocating ram) you have to
recalculate the near pointer to the video ram. That's why I suggest
you calculate the address after you initialize your program. With
this method you can access the video ram directly as fast as accessing any
other ram in your program. Another reason why DJGPP does not support this
directly, is that under Windows NT, you cannot use negative addresses.
OR
Use the DOS memory selector. This method is similar to
using far memory in your 16-bit compilers only it works
slightly differently, since there are no far pointers in DJGPP. Here is a
code snippet: 
#include 
void
main(void)
 {
 _farsetsel(_dos_ds);
 _farnspokeb(0xA0000, 4);
 } 
This method is slightly slower then the first method, but is more secure.
Do not worry, it is not too bad in performance if you can program it right,
(for example, the Allegro
game library uses this method). This method is more reliable then the first
method as you don't have to recalculate anything. In this example, it draws
a red pixel in the upper right hand corner in red. Now you don't need to
call _farsetsel for every write to the screen. You have to call
this once per function. For example in a function that displays a bitmap,
you would call _farsetsel once on the outside (near the top of the
function).
I suggest that you use the second method until you get more comfortable
with DJGPP. The second is a little slower then the first, but the first can
cause problems if used incorrectly. Also remember that the first method
does not work in Windows NT, but the second method does.
Calling Interrupts
This section describes how to call real mode x86 interrupts with DJGPP. 
In DJGPP it is not too differenent then calling interrupts with 16-bit compilers.
The most important thing to note is that you cannont use inline assembly
to call real mode interrupts directly. If you have ever used the
int86 or int386 functions then this one is pretty simple.
I will start with a code snipet: 
#include 
void
main(void)
{
 __dpmi_regs r;
 r.x.ax = 0x13;
 r.d.ebx = 0x10000;
 r.h.cl = 4;
 r.h.dh = 5;
 __dpmi_int(0x10, &r);
}
First off, the struct __dpmi_regs is a structure to hold all of
the 386 registers you wish to pass down to real mode. To access
the byte registers of __dpmi_regs you would use,
__dpmi_regs.h.xx, where xx is the register
(ah, al, bh, bl, etc...) is the register you wish to modify. To access the
word register you do the same for the byte registers but change the
h with a x. Now to use the
dword register just change the x with a d.
Now as you can see this demo, passes 0x13 into the wordreal mode.
When the interrupt is completed the structure you pass __dpmi_int
will contain the new register values. So you can read the result of the
interrupt. If you would like to see what the struct __dpmi_regs looks
like just open the file djgpp\include\dpmi.h.
Memory Layout
This section does not provide any example code just some general info. First
as stated in the section 'Physical vs. Linear' physical
addresses are not valid in DJGPP. This is important to note, but easy to fix.
The second causes great difficulty. Since addresses are not physical,
devices that require physical addresses (such as DMA) are
a little harder to program. I do not know alot about DMA but I can warn you
that you must consider three things.
- DMA memory blocks must be below 16MB.
- DMA memory blocks must be aligned on a 64KB page boundary.
- DMA requires that you pass the physical address of the block.
The easiest way I can think of getting around this is allocating a DOS
memory block. If you would like an example of this, I can dig one up and
put it in this page. 
Writing Assembly Code for DJGPP with NASM 
This section describes how to write assembly routines for DJGPP with
the Netwide Assembler. If you have any knowledge of assembly this section
is quite easy to understand. The syntax of NASM is quite simillar to TASM/MASM
but a lot simpler too, and fast. I will just show a code snippet and you
can observe the differences. 
; TASM code
P386
model flat, c
segment text USE32
; int test(int a, int b)
 PROC test
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov eax, [ebp+4]
 add eax, [ebp+8]
 inc [counter]
 pop ebp
 ret
 ENDP
ends
segment data use32
 counter dd 0
ends
end
As you can see from this routine, it just adds the two parameters together
then updates a counter. Not much too it, but shows the basics. Now the
NASM code
; NASM code
[bits 32]
[section .text]
global _test
_test:
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov eax, [ebp+4]
 add eax, [ebp+8]
 inc dword [counter]
 pop ebp
 ret
 
[section .data]
counter dd 0
;end of file
As you see the syntax is pretty much the same. There are however some
key things to note: 
- There is no offset keyword. For example:
 mov eax, offset _dummy
becomes:
 mov eax, _dummy
- To access a variable you cannot igonore the [].
 mov eax, _dummy
becomes:
 mov eax, [_dummy]
- There is no ENDS keyword.
- As of NASM 0.97, the align keyword does not work for COFF images.
- The align keyword cannot be used in the definition of a segment
but within the segment it can be used to align a label.
- To specify operand size you would put the size (byte, word or dword) outside
 the [] brackets. (This is important for push pop inc dec) For example:
 inc dword ptr [_dummy]
becomes:
 inc dword [_dummy]
If you don't put the dword keyword in front NASM will not know
the size of the data.
- If you want to change the address size type (inside the []) you would
 put the operand size keyword (byte, word or dword) in side.
- Segment overrides go inside the [].
 mov es:[_dummy], eax
becomes:
 mov [es:_dummy], eax
- You cannot use multiple operands with push or pop
 push eax ebx ecx
becomes:
 push eax
 push ebx
 push ecx
- Labels in NASM are case sensitive.
- NASM is simple to learn, just read the manual.
- There is no P386, P486, P586 etc... mnemonics in NASM. It always allows
 you to use any 8086 to 80586 (5x86\6x86 too) opcodes.
That is about all you need to know about NASM/DJGPP to get started. I
suggest you read the NASM reference manual to find out more about NASM's
powerful syntax. 
This sums up this chapter. I wish to make ammenmants to this section,
such as better code snipets, and more detailed explanations. If you have
questions about any area presented here please email me.
