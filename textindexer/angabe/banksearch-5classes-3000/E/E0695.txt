 Section 0: Preface 
Section 0.2: Who Is this Tutorial For?
This is a tutorial designed for a wide variety of people:
- Beginners who have never programmed before
- Programmers who have never used C++ before 
- C++ programmers who want to brush up
- Experienced C++ programmers who want a quick and easy 
reference.
 
 This tutorial is designed to meet the needs of almost
everyone. For example, a beginning programmer may get the most use
out of Part I and Part II, and put off Part IV and beyond until they
have acquired some more programming experience. On the other hand, a
 experienced programmer (but not experienced in C++) may skim
Sections 2-5, and jump right into Part III. 
 This tutorial
teaches the object model of programming. It may almost be easier
for a non-programmer to pick up the concepts behind object
programming than a semi-experienced procedural programmer. Users of
this tutorial should remember that Part III introduces some very
important concepts. It may be necessary to spend more time on
Sections 6 and 7 even if you are an experienced C (procedural)
programmer.
