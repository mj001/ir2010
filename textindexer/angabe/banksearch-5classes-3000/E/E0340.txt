Quote: "Just because you can, does not mean you should."
  Welcome! For some odd reason you decided to find out more about me. I suppose I could write an essay on being me, but I decided to keep it short and sweet. I go to Northern Illinois University where I am pursuing a B.S. in computer science and a minor in Japanese studies. Why Japanese? Well, I thought it would give me the chance to get to the West Coast and work and perhaps even visit Japan every once in awhile. Oh, I am a junior as of fall semester 2001, so that means I should graduate in May 2003. 
 I am the biggest Cub fan that I know, excluding people that can actually remember the last time the Chicago Cubs were in the World Series. ( I believe the year was 1945 and they lost to the Detroit Tigers in 7 games, the last one being at the Famous Wrigley Field...sigh) I enjoy playing video games, mainly RPGs and racing games, but I do enjoy a good book from time to time. I love to talk and sit around and gossip with all my female friends, whom are all great to me! 
 Please do enjoy my site, I am sorry that I do not get to update it as often as I would like too, but hey! I am in college and I do have to spend time doing my homework so I can become a world famous video game programmer. Sayonara!
