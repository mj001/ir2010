Visual C++: the Fast Track for C++ Development
Make the most of your development efforts with Microsoft Visual C++ development version 4.0. Create and code reuse and components, all with the latest Windows®-based 32-bit technology. Do this in a highly productive development environment designed to boost performance: yours.
Overview
Just because you're starting a new application, doesn't always mean starting from scratch. We're talking about reusing code and components from other applications to build new solutions.
The best way to do this is with Microsoft Visual C++ development system version 4.0, the tool designed to help you accelerate application development for the Microsoft Windows 95&#153; and Windows NT&#153; Workstation operating systems.
New to Visual C++ is the Component Gallery. It's a one-stop location for you to store and manage your reusable components, including C++ classes, OLE controls, and dozens of third-party components that enable you to quickly add advanced features.
Microsoft Developer Studio provides an interactive development environment to simplify object-oriented programming with new class navigation tools--such as ClassView and WizardBar--and seamless integration with other Microsoft tools.
And you can now create custom AppWizards for a fast start to building your applications.
Another way to accelerate development is with the popular Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library version 4.0. MFC contains more than 150 classes and 120,000 lines of code you don't have to write or test, and it includes support for creating applications that take advantage of the interface for Windows 95. 
For database applications, we've included Data Access Objects (DAO) classes for fast object-oriented access to the Jet database engine. And ODBC support for creating database-independent, client/server applications.
You can also bring your applications to a range of new users with the cross-platform support of Visual C++.
With the Microsoft Visual C++ Subscription, you get the latest version of Visual C++, plus three more releases over a year containing the latest tools and technical information. Automatically delivered to your desktop. 
It's everything you need to create applications that can display the "Designed for Windows 95" and "Windows NT Compatible" logos. No more wondering if you have the newest Visual C++ technology.
With this kind of convenience, it's no surprise that more and more developers who are looking for real performance gains are subscribing every day.

The Development Environment
ClassView makes it possible to manage your projects intuitively as a set of related classes, rather than a collection of files.
Other development tools are a mouse click away, conveniently located on the Visual C++ toolbar, such as the Microsoft Developer Network Development Library, Microsoft Fortran PowerStation, Microsoft Visual Test, and Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (all available separately). 
WizardBar allows you to quickly navigate and add message handlers and other member functions.
Component Gallery is a central location for components that you can insert into your project, including OLE Controls, your own C++ classes, as well as components from third parties.
Let a wizard speed your development.
 AppWizard steps you through the process of building an application. Create your own AppWizard to meet company-specific or industry requirements.
Use AppWizard to incorporate database support into applications. Choose from database-independent 32-bit ODBC or DAO with the Jet database engine for optimum performance.
Minimum rebuild compiles only the files needed. Incremental compiler compiles only the functions that have changed. And the incremental linker links only modules that have changed. All helping to reduce your rebuild time.
