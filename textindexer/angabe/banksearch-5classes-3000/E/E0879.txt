 How
 to Program in C
 by H.
 M. Deitel, P.
 J. Deitel
 
 
 Clear explanations for the beginner 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purchase
 
 
 
 
 Some authors are great for explaining the technical nitty gritty of
 C. These authors are great at just the opposite...providing
 clear and thorough explantions of the fundamentals of the language.
 
 In
 addition to getting the reader up to speed quickly, Deitel and Deitel
 also emphasize the importance of structured progamming and programming
 'best-practices'.
 
 An
 excellent tutorial for the new C Programmer.

 Beginning
 Visual C++ 6.0
 by Ivor
 Horton
 
 C++ "Made Easy" is NOT an oxymoron in this case! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purchase
 
 
 
 
 It is difficult to write a beginner's book on
 a topic like C++, but Ivor Horton (who wrote a Beginning Java book
 which 1 C Plus Plus Street also recommends) is up to the
 challenge. If you are looking for a quick read, be warned--this
 tome is over 1,000 pages long! But if you are a newbie with
 little or no programming experience, and are willing to invest the
 time required to master C++, this book will take you where you want to
 go.
 
 The book is split into two parts. The
 first half concentrates on the fundamentals. To simplify things
 as much as possible, all first-half applications are console
 based MSDos apps. In the second half, Horton takes the reader on
 a tour of the deep-end of the pool, with topics on the Microsoft
 Foundation Classes (MFC) and the Active Template Library (ATL).
 
 After reading this book and investing the
 time to follow the examples, a beginner can be confident in achieving
 a solid mastery of fundamental C++ skills.

 Advanced
 C++ Programming Style and Idioms
 by James
 O. Coplien
 
 Take your coding to the next level! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Purchase
 
 
 
 
 This book is not for beginners! If you don't have a solid
 understanding of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. then you
 should choose one of the other recommended books above.
 
 However, if you are an advanced C++ programmer who
 is looking to take your skills to the highest level, then this book is
 for you! The author, James Coplien, is a well respected systems
 architect with hundreds of thousands of lines of code under his belt,
 and his treatise reflects his truly vast field of experience. 
 Subjects include in-depth explorations of abstract data types,
 multiple inheritance, combining types in inheritance, virtual
 constructors, garbage collection and much more!
 
 This is one of the easiest to read advanced book of it's kind and is
 highly recommended! (5 planets out of 5)

 Building
 Object Applications That Work
 by Scott W. Ambler, Richard S. Wiener
 
 Absolutley brilliant tutorial on creating Object Oriented Systems. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Purchase
 
 
 
 All of the books
 in the 1 C Plus Plus Street 'recommended readings' are best-of-breed tomes. 
 However, I am not exagerating in any way when I say that this book blows
 every other book I've read in the past 2 years completely away.
 
 Let me
 first warn you that this book is NOT a programming book--it is an OO book. 
 So if you still get confused when you hear the word 'method' instead of
 'sub' or 'function', or if you think 'inheritance' only refers to
 how much you can expect to receive from your favorite aunt when she dies,
 you are probably not ready for this one yet. However, if you have a
 solid understanding of OO concepts and the experience to match, then this
 book can take your object designs, frameworks and implentations from the
 advanced level into the rarified air of the top 10% of all OO system
 designers and builders.
 
 Am I
 gushing about this book? I probably am, but I feel it deserves it. 
 A reviewer from Amazon.com echoes my sentiment when he says, "
 When it comes to actually designing and implementing object technology,
 the second volume of Ambler's trilogy is undoubtedly the best book so far
 in the software development business."
 
 If you're a frequent
 reader of OO texts, you'll find that most are more like religious
 treatises on the benefits of OO, rather than pragmatic instruction on how
 to build real-world systems. This book strikes a defiant stand
 against that trend. From topics like 'How to build an A-class object
 framework' to 'Constructing superior diagrams', to "How to persist
 objects', this book delivers invaluable information that would take a new
 OO developer years to discover on his/her own.
 
 If there is anything bad
 to say about this book, it is that occasionally the reader is forced to
 endure a little bit more of Ambler's ego than would be desired. 
 (Let's put it this way...the guy created his own modeling notation and
 named it after himself) However, in a genre where egos seem to run
 more rampant than rednecks do in the country-side, Ambler is hardly the
 worst offender (...right away, Booch comes to mind right away as being
 much worse...).
 
 So to
 summarize, this book is fantastic, and I heartily recommend it. It
 will help almost every developer do his/her job much better than they are
 now.
