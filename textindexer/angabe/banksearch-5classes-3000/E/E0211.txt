Section 2.3: Brief Explanation of "Hello, Dave"
Now that you've successfully compiled your program, let's take
a look at each line of code so that you have a general
understanding of how the program works. It will probably
look confusing if you've never seen C++ syntax before, but
that's completely natural.
Here's the program again:
//include this file for cout
#include 
int main() {
 //print out the text string, "Hello, World!"
 cout 
This line is read "pound include i-o-stream dot h". The
effect of this line is to essentially "copy and paste"
the entire file iostream.h into your own
file at this line. So you can think of this syntax
as replacing the line #include 
with the contents of the file iostream.h.
#include is known as a
preprocessor
directive, which will be covered much later.
Where is the file iostream.h?
This file is located somewhere in your include 
path. The include path
indicates the directories on your computer in which to search
for a file, if the file is not located in the current directory.
Why do I need to include iostream.h?
In this case, iostream.h is a file containing
code for input/output operations. You need to include
iostream.h so that the compiler knows about
the word cout, which appears a couple of
lines below.

int main() {
Every C++ program must have what is known as a
main function. 
When you run the program, the program will go through every
line of code in the
main function and execute it. If your 
main is empty, then your program will do
nothing.
There are essentially four parts to a function definition.
They are the return type,
the function name, the parameter
list, and the function body, in that order. In this case:
- return type: int
- function name: main
- parameter list: ()
- function body: { ... }
For now, the important thing to remember is that the function body
is the part enclosed in { ... } ("curly braces").
The { indicates the beginning of the function,
and the } indicates the end of the function. The
function body is the stuff in between.

//print out the text string, "Hello, World!"
Another comment line. Remember, the compiler ignores anything
following // (up until the end of the line), so you can
say whatever you want on these lines.
