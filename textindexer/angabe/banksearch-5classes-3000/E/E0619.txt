Alan Balmer is the 
 owner of Balmer Consulting, and is a veteran of over 20 years of 
 experience in all aspects of computing; from mainframes to microcomputers, 
 from design to debugging. His undergraduate work was 
 in physics and theoretical math, with a minor in chemistry, and 
 he has spent time as a logic circuit designer, electronics engineer 
 and NIR spectroscopy researcher, with an interesting but not 
 habit-forming excursion into management. He has been a member of 
 Team Powersoft, then Team Sybase, since the Compuserve days. His 
 software career began by writing circuit design programs in Fortran 
 and progressed to work on real-time process control operating 
 systems. He is (or has been) reasonably fluent in several 
 assembler languages, C, C++, Perl, Java, FORTRAN, BASIC, PASCAL, 
 and PL/I, and now thinks Python is neat. Al is now based in 
 Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and does a variety of things, from small business 
 consulting to writing device drivers for process 
 control, but spends the majority of his time writing C on Unix 
 systems for a manufacturer of card-based transaction and security 
 systems. Al enjoys writing tools and though interested in everything, 
 will likely concentrate on the Watcom auxiliary programs, 
 leaving the heavy-duty compiler work to younger and smarter 
 colleagues. You can contact Alan via email at
