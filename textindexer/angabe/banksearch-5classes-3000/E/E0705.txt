Intelligent 'enum's in C++ Applications
This article was contributed by 
Lloyd Willemsen.
Environment: C++
Keywords: Enumerations, strings, integers, automatic defaults.
On several occasions in the past I have found C++ enumerations lacking.
Enums need an automatic default and Enums need string functionality along with the integer value, particularily in applications that interact with a user either on a GUI or in an error message.
I thus concieved the idea to represent Enums as C++ classes which provide all the standard functionality of an enum, by overiding the relevant operators. And then adding the extra functionality desired.
Rather than writing these classes, a utility which translates standard Enum declerations to such classes would be great. Along with the idea, I have supplied a utility EC (enum compiler) that will do the job on Microsoft platforms.
In other words if I supply the following:
 enum EState
 {
 Unknown = 0,
 Solid = 1, // Solid Matter
 Liquid = 2, // "Liquid Matter "
 Gas, /* Vapour */
 };
One could generate a class as follows:
 class EState
 {
 public:
 // EState::Unknown,Solid,Liquid,Gas,
 enum Enum
 {
 Unknown = 0,
 Solid = 1, // "Solid Matter"
 Liquid = 2, // "Liquid Matter "
 Gas, // "Vapour"
 };
 Enum operator=(int i);
 operator int () const;
 Enum operator=(const char* sz);
 bool operator==(const char* sz);
 operator const char* () const;
 ...
 };
 EState::Map_t EState::m_Map[] =
 {
 {Unknown, "Unknown"},
 {Solid, "Solid Matter"},
 {Liquid, "Liquid Matter "},
 {Gas, "Vapour"}
 };
which could then be used as an "intelligent" Enum.
These "intelligent" Enums can be used as follows:
 int X;
 ...
 EState eState;
 eState = X;
 if(eState == EState::Unknown) {...}
 ...
 printf("eState is '%s' [%d]", (const char*)eState, eState);
 ...
 eState = "Text String";
 if(eState == EState::Unknown) ...
 ...
 
making some parts of coding simpler and more understandable.
