 In a single package,Watcom C/C++ provides a comprehensive development 
 environment with the tools, SDK's, and libraries you need to 
 create powerful 16- and 32- bit applications for popular PC 
 platforms. Combining an integrated development environment (IDE) 
 and a comprehensive set of tools with our state-of-the-art compiler 
 technology, Watcom C/C++ delivers productivity and performance.
 
 Multiple 
 Platforms In A Single Package
 Watcom C/C++ supports a wide range of host and target platforms 
 including Windows 95, Windows NT, OS/2, and extended DOS. This 
 impressive platform support is amplified by the powerful cross-platform 
 capabilities of the IDE and tools, which enable building applications 
 for a wide range of target environments from any of the host 
 systems. For example, from Windows NT you can build and debug 
 Windows 3.1, Win32s, 16-bit DOS, and 32-bit DOS applications, 
 in addition to Windows NT applications. This extensive cross-platform 
 support helps you to exploit the capabilities of your host platform. 
 
 
 High 
 Performance
 Watcom’s advanced compiler technology generates fast, tight 
 code, optimizing you application’s performance. With both 16- 
 and 32-bit compilers in a single package, you get the industry-leading 
 optimizing compiler team. Superscalar optimization strategy 
 uses "riscification" and instruction scheduling to deliver faster 
 executables on 486 and Pentium processors. Watcom C/C++ uses 
 incremental linking and improved pre-compiled header support 
 to achieve faster builds. Sophisticated optimization techniques 
 and precise compiler diagnostics help you create robust, reliable, 
 high-performance applications.
