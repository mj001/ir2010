passing 2d array as parameter into OpenGl
 
 
 Basically, I have a 2d array of values that I want to pass into a function which will output the points as a 2d matrix in OpenGl. 
As I am still very much in the learning phase, this is proving more difficult than perhaps it should be!
Does anyone have any hints/or know of any useful URL's.
Many thanks.
Nick.
