Links 'n' Stuff
Compilers Free and not-Free
DGJPP
- A free C/C++ compiler that I have never used, but it is ANSI standard so it
will do what you need for it to do.
GCC - An UNIX
based C/C++ compiler that I use for my classes ( because I have too ) that is
not to shabby, but you just need to learn your UNIX commands, sigh.
Microsoft's
Visual C/C++ Compiler - Ok, it is not free, but with a student discount you
can get the standard copy for around $50, which I think is totally worth the
money. You will thank me when you discover all the wonderful debugging tools.
 
Tutorials and Code
Programmers
Haven - Web site full of free code and other links to more tutorials. It's
like my page, just a lot better!
C
Programming - A site that would be the equivalent of a semester's worth of
notes in a C/C++ course.
C Plus Plus
- Lots of information here. Heck, even I go there to read up on stuff.
How
C Works - A very informative look at the How's and Why's the C compiler
works.
 
Neat Stuff that I Like
Northern Illinois
University - Ok, its a free plug where I go to school. I go there, so it
cannot be all bad, right?
Price Watch
- Your gateway to cheap computer products. A definite must go if you are looking
to build or upgrade your computer.
Tom's
Hardware Guide - A site full of information on computer technology.
