Craig is now a closet developer as he has 
 taken on a CEO role at Action Engine (http://www.actionengine.com). 
 He worked at Watcom from 1989 to 1993, on versions 8.0 through 
 9.5. He was reponsible for developing the Windows extender 
 (win386), the editor, the win16/win32/win386/os2 2 debuggers, the 
 win16/win32 runtime libraries and various and sundry other things 
 before moving to Microsoft in 1993. While at Microsoft, Craig was 
 the founding developer for the DirectX project, and left in 
 January of 2000 after spending almost 2 years as the General 
 Manager of the Windows Media Platform group. Craig is 
 still in Redmond, WA, having a blast doing the startup thing, and 
 among other things is doing programming for the Palm OS where his 
 16 bit, low memory, slow processor experience is finally paying 
 off. After all this time, Craig still secretly wishes he was 
 playing poker with his Watcom buddies again. You can contact Craig 
 at craig@theeislers.com.
