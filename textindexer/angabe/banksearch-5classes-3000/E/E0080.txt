Glossary
 algorithm 
 A series of steps that systematically outline how 
	to accomplish a goal.
 
	
 assembler 
 a piece of software that translates a specific 
	assembly language into 
	machine language 
	for a specific processor.
 
	
 assembly language 
 a set of instructions that a programmer
	can use to create a program for use on a specific 
	processor. Assembly language is translated into
	machine language by a piece of software called an
	assembler
 
	
 bit 
 The smallest possible unit of memory. A bit can store only
	two different values - a "0" or a "1". If a bit could
	store only one possible value, it would not store any information
	at all, because each bit would look identical. However, a
	bit storing one of two possible values can be combined with
	lots of other bits to store huge quantities of information.
	The term for a group of eight bits, a common occurrence,
	is called a byte. 
 
	
 byte 
 A small unit of memory.
	A byte is composed of eight bits. 
	One bit
	can store two different combinations (0 or 1), two bits can store
	four different combinations (00, 01, 10, 11), three bits can store 
	eight
	different combinations (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111);
	following the pattern,
	eight bits, or one byte, can store 256 different values.
 
	
 casting 
 The act of viewing (and often converting) the information 
	contained in a variable of one type as if that 
	information was of another type.
 
	
 class 
 ...
 
	
 comment 
 These are put into source code by programmers in order 
	to better explain what the code does. When source code is
	compiled into 
	assembly language, all comments 
	are removed. Comments
	only describe code, there is no action associated with them.
	Since comments are removed by the compiler, they can be
	written in plain English (or any other natural language
	you choose!).
 
	
 compiled 
 Once third-generation languages have been translated
	into assembly code and then to machine code, they are said
	to have been compiled. Loosely, this could also be used to
	refer to any single intermediate step.
 
	
 compiler 
 a piece of software that takes third-generation
	language code and translates it into a specific 
	assembly
	code. Compilers can be quite complicated pieces of software. 
 
	
 constructor 
 ...
 
	
 cout 
 In the C++ language, this is the name given to the standard
	output stream. When a buffer of characters is sent to this 
	stream, they will appear as output on the terminal the program
	was ran from.
 
	
 debug 
 the act of removing errors, logical mistakes, or 
	flow of control problems in a program.
 
	
 decimal 
 a number represented as a whole number and some fractional
	part as well. Decimal numbers either take up more memory than 
	integers, or are accurate to less places, or both.
 
	
 execute 
 The act of starting up and running a certain program.
	This involves loading the program from disk into main memory,
	reserving memory space for the program to work with, and
	sequentially executing the steps of the program as outlined 
	by the programmer
 
	
 function 
 ... 
	
 garbage 
 an all-encompassing term used to denote variable values 
	that are undefined, or bad input into a program.
 
	
 gcc 
 this is the name of the gnu C++ compiler. 
	This free compiler is
	frequently used on machines running the UNIX operating 
	system. The latest version of gcc can be
	downloaded
	via ftp.
 
	
 instruction set 
 a set of commands that a certain CPU 
	understands.
	These are very basic instructions that are wired into the 
	logic of the CPU.
 
	
 integer 
 a whole number value. In programming languages, integers
	also have a maximum value, depending on the language definition
	or the architecture of the machine that the code is compiled
	on
 
	
 keyword 
 a word that has some sort of predefined meaning in the
	context of a programming language
 
	
 machine language 
 a processor specific set of binary codes
	that correspond to actions to be taken by the processor of a 
	machine.
 
	
 main 
 In C++, this is the first function that is called when a 
	program is executed. When a program returns from main, 
	execution has been completed.
 
	
 object 
 ...
 
	
 operator 
 Acts on one or more subexpressions to produce a value. 
 
	
 parameter 
 a piece of data that is passed into a program,
	subroutine, or function call.
 
	
 path 
 A path is used to specify where certain files can be found
	in a directory tree. Sometimes path is used to mean where 
	an application looks to find certain files, such as "make
	sure stdio.h is in your path, or the compiler won't find it."
 
	
 portable 
 a description of how easy it is to take
	code written on one machine or system and
	correctly compile it on another
	machine or system. This process is called "porting".
 
	
 preprocessor directive 
 a command placed within a source code 
	listing, that directs the compiler to do something before
	the rest of the source code is parsed and compiled.
 
	
 private 
 ...
 
	
 protected 
 ...
 
	
 pseudo-code 
 a high-level abstraction of code, usually used to 
	outline the general steps in an algorithm
	without having to
	write actual code (usually done for the reader's 
	or programmer's benefit).
 
	
 public 
 ...
 
	
 public interface 
 ...
 
	
 return type 
 specifies the type of data that is returned from a
	function call. 
 
	
 type 
 describes what sort of information a variable
	stores, as
	well as how much space that information takes up.
 
	
 UNIX 
 A multi-processing, multi-user, family of operating systems 
	that run on a variety of architechtures. A shareware version
	of this operating system, Linux, runs on the IBM compatible 
	PC.
 
	
 variable 
 a name, given by a programmer, to represent a piece of 
	data within a certain program. This name is then used
	to refer to that piece of data.
 
	
 Windows 
 A family of operating systems created by Microsoft, that
	run on Intel based IBM compatible machines.
