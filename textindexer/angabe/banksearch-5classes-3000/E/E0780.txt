 C Keywords - goto
goto
As in all high-level programming languages the goto statement causes immediate branching to a new location back up in the code structure
(bad!) or further down the code structure. Branching can only occur
within the current function and not between functions.
For example
 start: if (i==0) goto finish;
 more lines of bad coding
 --a;
 goto start;
 finish:
As can easily be seen in the above example the use of the goto statement
can be avoided by using other block structure constructs, for example the while loop. The goto statement
should only be used in the last resort!
