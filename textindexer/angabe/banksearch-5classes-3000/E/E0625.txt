About Code Corner
Code Corner is devoted to programmers. Programmers wearing suits. Programmers
riding skateboards. Programmers with pony tails, with propeller hats, with
pocket protectors. Programmers who look like actors or models. Programmers
who eat only potato chips. Programmers who pilot planes. If you create
programs, applications, operating systems, interfaces or drivers for a
living, and take big time pride in what you do, Code Corner is for you.
If you call yourself an application developer or software engineer, you'll
still be allowed into Code Corner :-).
So hang out. Have fun. Praise
or flame Code Corner.
