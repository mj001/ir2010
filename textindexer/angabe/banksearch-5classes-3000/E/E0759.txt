 C - Keywords
Keywords
C is a relatively small language which uses only 32 keywords. Many of these will be covered in the course but for reference purposes the list of keywords is as follow:
auto	double	int	struct
break	else	long	switch
case	enum	register	typedef
char	extern	return	union
const	float	short	unsigned
continue	for	signed	void
default	goto	sizeof	volatile
do	if	static	while
Many of the keywords listed above will be covered on this course. However,
some have either limited use or are only used in advanced programming. Such keywords
are highlighted above where a brief desciption of their use is offered.
