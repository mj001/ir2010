 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>What is the role of Visual C++ 6.0 within Visual Studio? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Visual C++ 6.0 is a member of the Microsoft Visual Studio development tools suite, and enables Visual Studio developers to create the highest performance applications and components. Microsoft Visual Studio is a complete development tools suite that provides corporations with easy-to-use tools for building solutions. Visual Studio, Professional Edition enables developers to take full advantage of Microsoft Windows operating system and Web development. Visual Studio, Enterprise Edition is the complete suite for rapidly building data-centric enterprise solutions. For complete evaluation information about Visual Studio 6.0, please refer to the Visual Studio 6.0 Product Overview Guide.
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>What about pricing and availability? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Visual C++ 6.0 has been available through your reseller since September 2, 1998. See our Visual C++ 6.0 Pricing Web pages for the most up-to-date information.
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>What are the different editions of Visual C++ 6.0? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Visual C++ 6.0 comes in Standard, Professional and Enterprise editions. See the Visual C++ 6.0 Features by Edition chart for more information.
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>What kind of Internet support is included with Visual C++ 6.0? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Visual C++ includes significant Internet-focused support including native support for HTML and Dynamic HTML and the Internet Explorer 4.0 Common Controls in MFC. Building the power of Internet Explorer 4.0 into an MFC application or building small, fast controls for placement in a Web application are tasks Visual C++ enables better than any other development tool. ATL also contains a new control, the HTML control, for adding HTML and Dynamic HTML interfaces to COM projects.	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>When should I use Dynamic HTML? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Use Dynamic HTML when you want to enliven a Web site, easily access and display data from a database, update a page that is already displayed, or position content with total control anywhere in a browser. Dynamic HTML gives Visual C++ users the most flexibility in manipulating data on the client and creating the richest and most customized user interfaces. See the Dynamic HTML section of the MSDN Online Library for additional information.	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>Why should Visual C++ customers or prospective customers consider Visual Studio 6.0 instead of Visual C++ 6.0? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
With Visual Studio 6.0, Visual C++ customers don't have to give up anything. Instead of just getting Visual C++, they get Visual C++ along with Visual Basic, Visual InterDev, Visual J++ and Visual FoxPro. And, of course, there are many more tools included in Visual Studio 6.0, including: Visual Database Tools, Visual Modeler, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual SourceSafe, Microsoft Repository, Visual Studio Analyzer and more. Note: Some products mentioned here are included with Visual Studio 6.0, Enterprise Edition only. Please see the Visual Studio 6.0 Product Overview Guide for more detailed feature set information.	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>How does Visual C++ support legacy environments? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Flexible data provision and access with OLE DB as well as Customer Information Control System (CICS) support are the two primary ways in which Visual C++ supports legacy environments. Additionally, an OLE DB provider is included with the Enterprise Edition of Visual C++ for access to AS/400 systems.	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>What is the future of MFC? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
MFC will continue to track Windows innovations closely so that it remains the application framework of choice for professional Windows-based development. MFC will also become more granular and undergo a significant dependency minimization (much of this work has been done for Visual C++ 6.0). This continued focus on enhancing MFC should result in smaller and faster-loading MFC applications. Finally, MFC will continue to complement and interoperate with ATL, the library best suited for COM component and ActiveX control creation.	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>When should I use ATL and when should I use MFC? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
If you are building an application that takes full advantage of the Windows platform (including the latest user interface elements) or extends servers like Internet Information Server (IIS), MFC is the right choice. If you are building ActiveX controls or COM components that must be small and fast (appropriate for transfer over the Web or for high-performance, multitier scenarios), ATL will meet your needs. Of course many projects are not so clearly delineated, and in that case using both MFC and ATL together is appropriate. In fact, Microsoft uses both of these libraries to build its award-winning applications. With Visual C++ 6.0, integrating ATL into MFC is easier than ever, with full ATL Object Wizard support in MFC projects.	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>How do I obtain the documentation for Visual C++ 6.0? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Complete online documentation and help are included with Visual C++ 6.0. To order reference books, including the Visual C++ Language Reference and User's Guide, visit the developer section of Microsoft Press.	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>What types of development is Visual C++ best for? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
As the most powerful development tool available for Windows, Visual C++ 6.0 excels at creating a wide array of applications, including:
	
	
- Internet and Web applications, including Web server development
	
- Server-side components with ATL
	
- Rich user interfaces and robust applications with MFC
	
- Data-centric applications with the Visual Database Tools and Universal Data Access
	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>Can users of previous versions of Visual C++ or other development tools upgrade to Visual C++ 6.0 at a discounted price? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Yes, regular and competitive upgrades are available. Users should visit their local reseller for more information on upgrading to Visual C++ 6.0. Visit the Visual C++ 6.0 or Visual Studio 6.0 purchasing Web pages for more information.
