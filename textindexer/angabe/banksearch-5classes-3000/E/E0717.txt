Section 2.2: Compiling and Running
Depending on your computer and your compiler, the
process of compiling your program varies. For now,
we'll assume that you are using a
UNIX machine and the
gcc compiler. Gcc is
a free compiler which is available on virtually all
UNIX systems.
To compile your program, type the following command
at a UNIX prompt:
g++ hello.C -o hello
Make sure that g++ is in your path
and that you are running it in the directory containing
hello.C.
Congratulations - you've just compiled your first C++ program!
The program is called hello and is located in the same
directory containing the file hello.C. To run your
program, simply type hello at your UNIX prompt.
You should see the following output:
# hello
Hello, World!
# 
That's all there is to it!
