 Open Watcom is a joint effort between SciTech 
 Software Inc, Sybase®, 
 and a select team of developers, which will bring 
 the Sybase Watcom C/C++ and Fortran compiler products 
 to the Open Source community.
 
 The Open Watcom core team has already created 
 a binary 
 patch update release (11.0c) targeted at existing 
 Watcom C/C++ and Fortran customers.
 
 Once the core team completes removal of all non-Sybase 
 code from the Watcom compilers, the source code 
 will be released on this web site, so that any 
 developer will be able to freely use and modify 
 it.
