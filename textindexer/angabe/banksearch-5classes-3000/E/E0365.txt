Test Conditions and Loops
Test Conditions and Loops
 OK, now we move onto the
next part of C/C++ that can be very useful to most people, unless you are some
sort of programming God who can program something without test conditions or
loops, and if so then i want to meet you and do my research work under you.
Basically, test conditions test to see whether or not something will happen and
then a loop will continually repeat itself until a condition is met. I hope this
helps some, if not then move to Oregon and watch the rain.
