 9. PHP Libraries 
The PHP is a object-oriented scripting language. Hence PHP code is 
"classes, classes, classes and classes". When you write PHP code you must 
design your classes such that they are re-usable or they use existing PHP classes.
There are hundreds of PHP classes already written and ready to use. There are
classes for accessing databases, classes for generating XML, HTML forms, classes for
creating tables, forms and other HTML objects. If you write some generic classes then
please upload to sites. By year 2005, there will be more than hundred million 
re-usable PHP classes. Advantage of PHP classes are they provide - data hiding,
inheritance, encapsulation, reliability, reusability and polymorphism.
The most important PHP sites are PHP classes and PEAR as given below.
 9.1 Classes and PEAR 
Visit the following web sites which have large collections of
ready to use PHP class libraries. 
- PHP classes are at 
http://phpclasses.upperdesign.com.
- PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository) is a code repository
for PHP extensions and PHP library code similar to Perl's CPAN and is at
http://pear.php.net and 
mirror 
linux 
php-pear-rpms
and 
pear-tutorials.
- ADODB (Active Data Objects Data Base) 
http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB :
PHP's database access functions are not standardised. Every database extension uses a different
and incompatibile API. This creates a need for a database class library to hide the
differences between the different databases (encapsulate the differences) so we can easily
switch databases. 
ADODB currently support MySQL, 
PostgreSQL
, Interbase, Oracle, MS SQL 7, 
Foxpro, Access, ADO, Sybase and generic ODBC. 
See also 
ADODB-manual.
The 
PhpLens is based on ADODB.
