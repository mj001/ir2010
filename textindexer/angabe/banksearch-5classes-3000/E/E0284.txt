The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can be got from - 
http://www.sgmltools.org
Compiling the source you will get the following commands like
- sgml2html xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate html file)
- sgml2html -split 0 xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate a single page html file)
- sgml2rtf xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate RTF file)
- sgml2latex xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate latex file)
 20.1 Acrobat PDF format 
PDF file can be generated from postscript file using 
either acrobat distill or Ghostscript.
And postscript file is generated
from DVI which in turn is generated from LaTex file.
You can download distill software from 
http://www.adobe.com. Given below 
is a sample session:
bash$ man sgml2latex
bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
bash$ man dvips
bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
bash$ distill filename.ps
bash$ man ghostscript
bash$ man ps2pdf
bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
bash$ acroread output.pdf &
Or you can use Ghostscript command ps2pdf.
ps2pdf is a work-alike for nearly all the functionality of 
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product: it
converts PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 
ps2pdf is implemented as a very small command script 
(batch file) that invokes Ghostscript, selecting a special "output device"
called pdfwrite. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite 
device must be included in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled;
see the documentation on building Ghostscript for details.
 20.2 Convert linuxdoc to Docbook format 
This document is written in linuxdoc SGML format. The Docbook SGML format
supersedes the linuxdoc format and has lot more features than linuxdoc.
The linuxdoc is very simple and is easy to use. To convert linuxdoc SGML 
file to Docbook SGML use the program ld2db.sh and some PERL scripts.
The ld2db output is not 100% clean and you need to use the clean_ld2db.pl
PERL script. You may need to manually correct few lines in the document.
- Download ld2db program from 
http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~rrt/docbook.html
or from 
Milkyway Galaxy site
- Download the cleanup_ld2db.pl PERL script from
from 
Milkyway Galaxy site
The ld2db.sh is not 100% clean, you will get lots of errors when you run
 bash$ ld2db.sh file-linuxdoc.sgml db.sgml
 bash$ cleanup.pl db.sgml > db_clean.sgml
 bash$ gvim db_clean.sgml 
 bash$ docbook2html db.sgml
And you may have to manually edit some of the minor errors after 
running the PERL script. For e.g. you may need to put closing tag for each 
 20.3 Convert to MS WinHelp format 
You can convert the SGML howto document to Microsoft Windows Help file, 
first convert the sgml to html using:
 bash$ sgml2html xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate html file)
 bash$ sgml2html -split 0 xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate a single page html file)
Then use the tool 
HtmlToHlp.
You can also use sgml2rtf and then use the RTF files for generating winhelp files.
 20.4 Reading various formats 
In order to view the document in dvi format, use the xdvi program. The xdvi
program is located in tetex-xdvi*.rpm package in Redhat Linux which can be
located through ControlPanel | Applications | Publishing | TeX menu buttons.
To read dvi document give the command -
 xdvi -geometry 80x90 howto.dvi
 man xdvi
And resize the window with mouse.
To navigate use Arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down keys, also
you can use 'f', 'd', 'u', 'c', 'l', 'r', 'p', 'n' letter
keys to move up, down, center, next page, previous page etc.
To turn off expert menu press 'x'.
You can read postscript file using the program 'gv' (ghostview) or 
'ghostscript'.
The ghostscript program is in ghostscript*.rpm package and gv 
program is in gv*.rpm package in Redhat Linux
which can be located through ControlPanel | Applications | Graphics menu 
buttons. The gv program is much more user friendly than ghostscript.
Also ghostscript and gv are available on other platforms like OS/2,
Windows 95 and NT, you view this document even on those platforms.
- Get ghostscript for Windows 95, OS/2, and for 
all OSes from 
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost
To read postscript document give the command -
 gv howto.ps
 ghostscript howto.ps
You can read HTML format document using Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet
explorer, Redhat Baron Web browser or any of the 10 other web browsers.
You can read the latex, LyX output using LyX a X-Windows front end to latex.
