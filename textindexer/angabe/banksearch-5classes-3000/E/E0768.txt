and the author of ``The C++ Programming Language''
(
1st edition 1985,
2nd edition 1991
3rd edition 1997
"special" edition 2000 1997) and 
The Design and Evolution of C++.
His research interests include distributed systems, operating systems,
simulation, design, and programming.
Dr. Stroustrup is the head of AT&T Lab's Large-scale Programming Research
department, an AT&T Bell Laboratories Fellow, and an
AT&T Fellow.
He is actively involved in the ANSI/ISO standardization of C++.
Recipient of the 1993
ACM Grace Murray Hopper award.
ACM fellow.

general history, light literature, photography, hiking and running,
travel
(e.g. to 
Australia,
Iceland,
and
India)

their daughter and son study in universities.
Biography for people who prefer longer sentences:
Bjarne Stroustrup designed and implemented C++. Over the last decade, C++
has become the most widely used language supporting object-oriented programming
by making abstraction techniques affordable and manageable for mainstream
projects. Using C++ as his tool, Stroustrup has pioneered the use of
object-oriented and generic programming techniques in application areas
where efficiency is a premium; examples include general systems programming,
switching, simulation, graphics, user-interfaces, embedded systems,
and scientific computation.
 
His book "The C++ Programming Language" (Addison-Wesley, first edition 1985,
second edition 1991, third edition 1997, "special" edition 2000) is the most
widely read book of its kind and has been
translated into 14 languages. A later book, "The Design and Evolution of C++"
(Addison-Wesley, 1994) broke new ground in the description of the way a
programming language was shaped by ideas, ideals, problems, and practical
constraints. In addition to his five books, Stroustrup has published more
than sixty academic and more popular papers.
He took an active role in the creation of
the ANSI/ISO standard for C++.

In 1990, "The Annotated C++ Reference Manual" received Dr Dobb's "Jolt Cola"
award for excellence in technical
documentation.
In 1995: "The Design and Evolution of C++" received a Dr Dobb's "Productivity
Award" for helping programmers to improve their code.
Bjarne Stroustrup is an AT&T Bell Laboratories Fellow and an AT&T Fellow.
He received the 1993 ACM Grace Murray Hopper award for his early work on C++
and is an ACM fellow.
Senior member of the IEEE.
He served on the Danish Research Council.
He was named one of "America's twelve top young scientists" by Fortune Magazine
in 1990 and as one of "the 20 most influential people in the computer industry
in the last 20 years" by BYTE magazine in 1995.
Bjarne Stroustrup is the consulting editor for Addison Wesley's
C++ In Depth series.
The aim of the series is to present
"short focussed books that directly address specific technical
audiences".
Bjarne was born in and grew up in
 Aarhus,
the second largest city in
 Denmark.
He went to
 Aarhus University
studying in the department of computer science 
 DAIMI
gaining the Danish equivalent
to a good Masters degree (a Cand.Scient. degree is rarely taken in
significantly less than six years - at least it wasn't then).
Aarhus is a wonderful town of about 250,000 people beautifully sited on the East
coast of Jutland.
Bjarne did his Ph.D. work on design of distributed systems in the
 Computing Laboratory
of
 Cambridge University, England.
He is a member of Churchill College
where he and his wife, Marian, spent some wonderful and busy years
and where their daughter, Annemarie, was born.
 Cambridge
is another wonderful town and one of the magical places of the world.
In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, together with his wife and daughter, moved to
New Jersey
to join the
Computer Science Research Center of Bell Telephone Laboratories.
Over the years, they lived in Summit, Meyersville, and (now) Watchung - all about
10 minutes drive from
Bell Labs'
main research site in Murray Hill.
A son, Nicholas, was born in Meyersville.
After the 1984 break-up of the Bell System
Bell Labs became AT&T Bell Labs, and after the 1995 break-up of AT&T, AT&T
Bell Labs was itself split into
AT&T Labs
and
Lucent Technologies Bell Labs.
The research part of AT&T Labs,
where Bjarne now works is the half of Bell Labs Information Sciences Research that
 AT&T kept to itself as
 Lucent and
 NCR were spun off.
In our lab, we have been having some fun with video lately.
If you have
recent QuickTime browser plugins,
you should be able to view a panorama image of my office.
To navigate the panorama, click the mouse in the picture and begin 
moving it around. By moving it left and right you should be able to 
turn the view in those directions, including turning around a full 
360 degrees. The farther from the center the mouse is held, the 
faster the turning. The mouse can be pulled outside the image 
for even faster turns.
Shift and Control keys can be used when the mouse is in the picture 
to zoom in and out.
