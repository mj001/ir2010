Preparing such a large project for its Open Source debut will take several months, so initially SciTech Software and a select group of external developers will be working to prepare the source code for release under an Open Source license. Once the source code has been prepared for release, the complete source to the Open Watcom products will be released on this web site. We hope that the Open Source 1.0 compiler release will be ready sometime near the end of the third quarter of 2001.
