In cooperation with 
 
Delphi Books
Because C++Builder and Delphi share the same VCL code base and the same IDE, any good Delphi
book can double as a C++Builder book. The Delphi books that I list here contain a wealth of
information on how to utilize the VCL to its fullest capabilities. I have listed a wide
variety of Delphi books, including books that cover the database classes, component writing,
or that act as a general VCL reference. Have a look around and see what you think.

Delphi 4 Developer's Guide covers a broad range of topics, including database programming, MIDAS, component development,
the OpenTools API and DLLs. Xavier Pacheco is a member of TeamB, and Steve Teixeira worked on the Delphi development
team at Borland. Of all the C++Builder and Delphi books out there, the Delphi Developer's Guide is the book that
I refer to the most.
