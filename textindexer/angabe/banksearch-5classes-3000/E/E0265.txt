The C/C++ 
Download Site
Hello, all programmers of the world! This is my shabby attempt
to create a site to freely exchange C/C++ programs so that others
can learn by example and possibly learn a thing or two. I am
currently a college student and I know what it is like to learn
something new about a language and have no idea what the
professor is talking about, what the new thing even does, or have
no idea how to implement the new syntax into any program. So, I
thought it would be nice to have some sort of free exchange for
all learners, mainly STUDENTS, to look at and analyze before
sitting in front of a computer and trying to get a program to run
without understanding the rules or procedure to implement any
programming technique. 
For my site, I will try to have as many links as possible (
all working hopefully ) and the programs will be divided into
categories for easier access to the coding technique you want to
learn. All programs will be in a .ZIP format so having an
unzipping program is a must, along with the file, I will try to
have the code on the page either in a text format or in HTML (
txt is so much easier though ) and possibly an example of how
the program would look if you ran the file on your computer.
Finally, I am asking anyone who is interested to email me and
submit the programs you have written for any C or C++ programming
class. These programs could have been written in high school,
junior college, a 4 year university or even in your spare time.
These programs can be in any range of difficulty from beginner
courses to courses involving data processing or even Object
Oriented design. If you do become interested in submitting some
programs for this site or just interested in helping please email
me or check out the FAQ.
