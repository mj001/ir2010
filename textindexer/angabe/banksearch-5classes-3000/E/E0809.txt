The C++ Programming Language
(Third Edition and Special Edition)
 Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-88954-4 and 0-201-70073-5.
The "special edition" is the hardcover version of the 3rd edition.
It differs from the early printings of the 3rd edition by about 1,000
corrections and clarifications,
by two new appendices (just over 100 pages; also available online, see below),
and by an improved index.
The only difference between the current printings of the special edition and
the 3rd edition is the cover (and the price difference implied by that
stronger cover).

Back Cover text:
More than 500,000 programmers have benefited from previous editions.
This is a complete rewrite of the most trusted book on C++.
Based on
the ANSI/ISO C++ standard,
this book covers the C++ language,
its standard library, and key design techniques as an integrated whole.
The C++ Programming Language provides comprehensive coverage of C++
language features and standard library components.
For example:
- 
abstract classes as interfaces
- 
class hierarchies for object-oriented programming
- 
templates as the basis for type safe generic software
- 
exceptions for regular error handling
- 
namespaces for modularity in large-scale software
- 
run-time type identification for loosely-coupled systems
- 
the C subset of C++ for C compatibility and systems-level work
- 
standard containers and algorithms
- 
standard strings, I/O streams, and numerics
With this third edition Stroustrup makes C++ even more accessible to those
new to the language while adding information and techniques that even expert
C++ programmers find invaluable.

 Bjarne Stroustrup is the designer and original
implementor of C++ and the author of
The C++ Programming Language (
 first edition 1985,
 second edition 1991 ),
 The Annotated C++ Reference Manual, and
 The Design and Evolution of C++.
A graduate of the University of Aarhus, Denmark, and Cambridge University,
England, Dr. Stroustrup is currently the head of
AT&T Labs' Large-scale
Programming Research Department and an AT&T Bell Laboratories Fellow.
His research interests include distributed systems, operating systems,
simulation, and programming.
Reviews:
Peter Salus in ;login: October 1997:
Unlike those annoying volumes whose pages are filled with screendumps, this is
full of real information. Bjarne has done a splendid job in this total rewrite
of his important work.
Mini review by Francis Glassborow (Editor of C Vu (Journal of the Association
of C and C++ users), September 1997:
Do not be deceived, this is a new book reusing an old title. It took three
years to write and was critiqued by 12 technical reviewers and the author
took every one of their comments seriously. That is what it takes to write
a good programming
book (and even so some errors got missed). ... I will go out on a limb and
declare that if you have not read this book at least once during the next
twelve months you are not a C++ programmer whatever you may think. As always,
you will only get full benefit from your reading by thinking about what you
read.
