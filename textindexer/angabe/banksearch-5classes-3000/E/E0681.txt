 Section 1.1 
 Structure of a C++ program 
 
 
 
 
Probably the best way to start learning a programming language is with a program.
So here is our first program:
// my first program in C++
#include 
int main ()
{
 cout 
Sentences that begin with a pound sign (#) are directives for the preprocessor.
They are not executable code lines but indications for the compiler.
In this case the sentence #include tells the compiler's
preprocessor to include the iostream standard header file.
This specific file includes the declarations of the basic standard
input-output library in C++, and it is included because its functionality is used later
in the program.
int main ()
This line corresponds to the beginning of the main function
declaration. The main function
is the point by where all C++ programs begin their execution.
It is independent from whether it is at the beginning, at the end or by the middle of the
code - its content is always the first to be executed when a program starts.
In addition, for that same reason, it is essential that all C++ programs have a
main function.
main goes followed by a pair of parenthesis ()
because it is a function. In C++ all functions are followed by a pair of parenthesis
() that, optionally, can include arguments within them. The content of the
main function follows immediately to its formal declaration enclosed
between curly brackets ({}), as in our example.
cout 
int main ()
{
 cout 
int main ()
{
