Article of the day
Interview by IEEE Computer from IEEE Computer Magazine, June 1998.
C++ is a general purpose programming language with a bias towards systems
programming that
- is a better C
- supports data abstraction
- supports object-oriented programming
- supports generic programming.
I (Bjarne Stroustrup)
am the designer and original implementor of C++.
You can find the language, the techniques for using it, and the techniques
for implementing it described in my
books,
my
papers,
in hundreds of books by others, and thousands of papers by others.
There are far too many to list.
Try a bookstore or a library.
Answers to many questions about C++ can be found in
- 
my FAQ,
- 
my C++ Style and Technique FAQ
- 
my C++ glossary, and
- 
some interviews that I have given.
C++ has been standardized by ANSI (The American National Standards Institute),
BSI (The British Standards Institute),
DIN (The German national standards organization),
several other national standards bodies,
and ISO (The International Standards Organization).
You can find a
slightly out-of-date draft standard here.
The ISO standard has been finalized and adopted by unanimous vote Nov 14, 1997.
It was ratified in August 1998 by a 22-0 vote.
The standard is ISO/IEC 14882;
it is available for downloading at the
National Committee for Information Technology Standards Electronic Store.
The cost is (as I write this) US$18.00 payable on-line via credit card.
The downloaded document is in PDF form, 2794KB total size.
The ISO C++ standards committee maintains an
official site
with information about the current state of the standards effort.
Here is a press release about C++ and its standard
intended for non-programmers and
a press release about the availability of the standard.
My book
The Design and Evolution of C++
describes the standards process and many of the design decisions made.
My book
The C++ Programming Language (Special Edition) describes
C++ as defined by the ISO standard.
Discussions about C++ and its use can be found in most forums covering
programming. The usenet groups comp.lang.c++.moderated and
alt.comp.lang.learn.c-c++ are good examples. These groups can be accessed in
various ways including
Google Groups (sort by date).

High-performance numerical libraries provide excellent tests for interesting new programming techniques:
POOMA from LANL,
Blitz++ from U. of Waterloo,
MTL from U. of Notre Dame,
and
ROOT from CERN.
Note that the POOMA project maintains
a page listing compilers that are standards conforming enough for their
advanced uses.
All of these libraries are available for downloading.

because I wanted to endorse a product.
All the major software suppliers have C++ related information on their sites.
