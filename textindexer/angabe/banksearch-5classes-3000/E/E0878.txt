 C and C++ Style Guides
 
 
 
 
 
 super hot
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This page offers access to many style guides for code written in C and C++, as well as some discussion about the value and utility of such style guides. This collection includes two style guides that are based on work done at Bell Labs Indian Hill (the site in Naperville, Illinois where the 5ESS digital switch is developed).

 C Programming Reference
 
 
 
 
 
 super hot
 
 
 
 updated
 
 
 This document is an attempt at producing a reference guide for the C programming language. To date, I have found several C tutorials and lessons on the net but no reference documents. This is not an attempt to replace the many high quality books available, but does try to provide an on-line reference that can give answers to questions quickly and without hasle.
