BCB6 Header file fixes
Disclaimer
The download section of this article contains patched BCB6 header files. These header files come
with no guarantees. The supplied files could introduce bugs into your programs, crash your
system, corrupt your BCB installation, reformat your hard drive, and/or cause your dog to walk funny.
If you decide to use the files supplied in the download, you do so at your own risk.
Note
This article discusses BCB6 header file problems. Specifically, it covers problems in the initial,
unpatched version of C++Builder 6.0. If and when Borland issues a patch for BCB6, it will probably
render this article obsolete.
Summary of header file problems
BCB6 contains a couple of header file problems. They are:
- The header files pshpack*.h and poppack.h contain
serious defects regarding structure alignment (originally discovered by Alex Bakaev)
- The header files hash_map.h and hash_set.h are missing.
- cstring.h and oldstl/cstring.h contain preprocessor typos.
- _str contains a logic error (#ifndef problem found by Arne Weise).
The download for this article includes patched versions of the pshpack and poppack files, and patched versions of
cstring.h and _str.h. It also contains the missing
files for the hash containers. To patch your system, download the ZIP file and extract the files to a temp directory. Compare the patched
files with the files in your $(BCB)\include directory. If you are satisfied with the changes, copy the patched files over to the
include directory, overwriting the original files with the same name.
pshpack and poppack bugs
The pshpack header files set the structure alignment compiler setting (-a) to a specific value. This is done with a
#pragma pack() directive. The file pshpack1.h switches to byte alignment (-a1). The digit '1' in pshpack1
corresponds to the -a1 compiler switch. The files pshpack2.h, pshpack4.h, and pshpack8.h, correspond to the
-a2, -a4, and -a8, switches respectively. The header file poppack.h resets the alignment to
the original compiler setting. Together, these files help ensure that the compiler always aligns API structures the same way, regardless of what
compiler setting you use to build your program.
Unfortunately, the pshpack header files that ship with BCB6 contain a flaw. Each pshpack file contains two #pragma
directives, one at the beginning and one at the end of the file, that interfere with the #pragma pack command. For example, the
file pshpack1.h ends up looking like this when you sift through all of the conditional defines:
// contents of $(BCB)\include\pshpack1.h in BCB6
#pragma option push -b -a8 -pc -A- /*P_O_Push*/
#pragma pack(1)
#pragma option pop /*P_O_Pop*/
The bug comes from the two #pragma option directives that appear at the top and bottom of the file. The first #pragma option command
pushes the original alignment setting onto the compiler's internal stack and then sets the alignment to -a8. The #pragma pack(1) command
sets the packing to -a1 without using the internal stack (it just sets it). However this setting is short lived. When the compiler reaches the
last #pragma option pop directive, it pops from the internal stack and restores the compiler settings that were in force at the beginning of the
file. The #pragma pack() command is essentially wiped out.
The code fragment below demonstrates the flaw in the pshpack header files.
#pragma hdrstop
// To test pshpack.h and poppack.h, compile this file with the -a2 compiler
// option. The check below ensures that this was done.
#pragma checkoption -a2
// include pshpack1.h and verify that alignment is -a1. If pshpack1.h works
// correctly, the checkoption should not generate an error
#include 
#pragma checkoption -a1
// include poppack.h and verify that alignment is back to -a2. This initially
// succeeds in BCB6, but only because pshpack1.h is broken. If you fix
// pshpack1.h, then you will see that poppack.h also has the bug.
#include 
#pragma checkoption -a2
int main()
{
 return 0;
}
To fix the problem, delete the #pragma option directives from pshpack1.h, pshpack2.h, pshpack4.h, and
pshpack8.h. The header file poppack.h contains the same problem, so you should fix it as well. The download for this article
contains patched versions of each of these files.
Missing includes for hash_map and hash_set
BCB6 includes two STL implementations: STLport and Rogue Wave. You can use either library in your projects. To support both
libraries, Borland has reorganized the STL header files into various subdirectories. The RW files reside in the oldstl subdirectory of
$(BCB)\include. The STLport files are spread out across several subdirectories, but the most important files reside in the stlport
and stl subdirectories. The include files in $(BCB)\include directory act as wrapper files. They detect which STL you are using,
and then pull in the correct file from either the RW or STLport subdirectories.
The file vector.h from the BCB include directory demonstrates what these wrapper files look like.
// a snippet of code from $(BCB)\include\vector.h
#ifdef _USE_OLD_RW_STL
# include 
#else
# include 
#endif
One of the nice features of STLport is that it provides common, non-standard extensions to the STL. These include hash based containers, a single linked
list container, and the rope string class. Unfortunately, the wrapper header files for the hash containers is missing (the STLport files are
there, but the wrappers are not). There are two solutions to this problem. First, you could add the directory $(BCB)\include\stlport to your
include path. The second option is to create wrapper files yourself and put them in the $(BCB)\include directory with the other wrappers.
The first option works, but it requires that you violate Borland's guidelines (see $(BCB)\help\bcb6_stlport.html). Because the wrapper files
are so simple, the second option may be the better approach.
The download for this article includes wrapper header files for hash_set and hash_map. Extract them to your $(BCB)\include
directory. The include for hash_map looks like this:
/**************************************************************************
 * Wrapper header file used to select STL via defines.
 * Default is STLport.
 **************************************************************************/
/* HJH Note: BCB6 did not include a wrapper header file for hash_map
 * This file was created to act as one.
 */
#ifdef _USE_OLD_RW_STL
# error hash_map is not available with the RW STL.
#else
# include 
#endif
#if !defined(__USING_STD_NAMES__) && defined(__cplusplus)
using namespace std;
#endif /* __USING_STD_NAMES__ */
Problems with cstring.h and oldstl/cstring.h
The file $(BCB)\include\cstring.h contains this set of conditional code:
# ifdef __USE_OLD_RW_STL
# include 
# else
# include 
The file $(BCB)\include\oldstl\cstring.h contains a similar conditional. The problem is the
define for using the old RW STL. In all of the other BCB6 header files, the define is listed as _USE_OLD_RW_STL
(only one underscore in front). cstring.h and oldstl\cstring.h are the only two files that list the two
underscore version.
The solution to this problem is to remove the first underscore.
 
Note:
This bug will only impact you if you use the old RW STL with BCB6. However, if you do use the RW STL, you should strongly consider making this change.
 
_str.h bug
$(BCB)\include\_str.h contains this:
#ifndef _USE_OLD_RW_STL
# include 
#else
# include 
#endif
This logic should be reversed. The code should include oldstl/locale.h if RW is detected. The conditional test should be an
ifdef instead of an ifndef.
