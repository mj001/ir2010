 Section 5: Functions 
Section 5.1: What is a Function?
Up until this point, every line of code we've shown you has done a
simple task, such as performing an arithmetic operation, or checking a
boolean condition, or assigning to a variable. Functions allow you to do a whole lot
in one line of code. Instead of performing a simple task, a single
line of code can display a menu of choices, or compute complicated
three-dimensional transformations, or even play Tetris!
How is this possible? Functions allow you to group a series of steps
under one name. Remember in Section 1.1
when we were baking chocolate chip cookies? We had to perform the
following steps:
place two eggs in a bowl
add 1.5 c. butter to the eggs
...
bake cookies for 10-12 minutes at 375 degrees or until brown
In C++, and in most programming languages, you can give a name to a
series of steps. Let's say we want to call this procedure "bake
cookies". Then, our algorithm for baking cookies becomes:
bake cookies
We've just created a function to do the work for us. Don't get too
excited - you still need to know how to bake the cookies. You still
need to know that the first step is placing two eggs in a bowl, and
that the second step is adding butter to the eggs. In this example,
what you would do is write a function called bakeCookies
(C++ won't let you put spaces in the names of functions or variables)
that performs the series of steps above, and then whenever you wanted
to bake cookies, you would call the function
bakeCookies, which would execute the lines of code
necessary to carry out the procedure.
Note: When we say you are calling the function
bakeCookies, we do not mean that you are giving it the
name bakeCookies - you've already done that by writing
the function. We mean you are executing the code in the
function bakeCookies. "Calling a function" really means
"telling a function to execute".
What are functions good for?
At this point, we've seen one reason why functions are useful.
Functions let us create logical groupings of code. If someone is
reading your code, and she sees that you call a function
bakeCookies, she knows immediately that you are baking
cookies. If, on the other hand, she sees that your code places eggs
in a bowl, then adds butter, etc., it will not be clear right away
that you are trying to bake cookies. Lots of recipes start out with
putting eggs in a bowl, and lots of recipes add butter to the eggs.
By the time she reads the last line, she might realize that you are
baking cookies, but only if she is familiar with the recipe. It's
possible that she won't realize that you are baking cookies at all!
The point is, functions make your code much easier to read.
There is an even better reason to use functions: they can make your
code shorter. Fewer lines of code is not always desirable, but every
time you write a line of code, there's the possibility that you are
introducing a bug. Functions start to
reduce the number of lines of code when you call them repeatedly.
Suppose that you want to mail out invitations to eight of your friends
for a cocktail party. Let's assume that you need to do the following
procedure in order to invite your friend Hank.
 write Hank's name on the invitation
 write Hank's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
It takes five lines of pseudo-code to invite one friend, so it takes
40 lines of pseudo-code to invite eight friends. It would look like
this:
 write Hank's name on the invitation
 write Hank's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
 write Ann's name on the invitation
 write Ann's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
 write Alicia's name on the invitation
 write Alicia's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
 write Whitney's name on the invitation
 write Whitney's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
 write Greg's name on the invitation
 write Greg's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
 write Mi Young's name on the invitation
 write Mi Young's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
 write Flavio's name on the invitation
 write Flavio's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation on the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
 write Brian's name on the invitation
 write Brian's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
That's a lot of repeated code, and any time you repeat code like this,
you are more likely to add a bug to your program. For example, look
at what we're doing with Flavio's invitation - we are placing it
on, not in, the envelope! We sealed his envelope and
dropped it in the mail, but there was no invitation inside. Flavio
will receive an empty envelope and he'll be mighty confused. That's a
mistake that resulted from having to type the same lines of code over
and over again.
Functions can substantially reduce the amount of pseudo-code you need
to write to invite your eight friends to the party. It seems unlikely
that you'd be able to reduce this at all - each of your friends has
got to have their own personally addressed invitation, and all of the
envelopes have to be sealed and stamped and placed in the mail. How
are we going to reduce the number of lines of code? Let's create a
function called inviteToParty which does the following
procedure:
 write Hank's name on the invitation
 write Hank's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
Now that we have this function, we can call it
eight times to invite our eight friends:
 inviteToParty
 inviteToParty
 inviteToParty
 inviteToParty
 inviteToParty
 inviteToParty
 inviteToParty
 inviteToParty
You probably noticed a problem with doing it this way. We're inviting
Hank eight times, and none of our other friends are going to receive
invitations! Hank will get invited eight times because the function
invites Hank to the party, and the function is being called
eight times. The solution is to modify the function so that it
invites friend to the party, where friend can be any of
your friends. We'll change our function so that it looks like this:
 write friend's name on the invitation
 write friend's name and address on the envelope
 place the invitation in the envelope
 seal and stamp the envelope
 drop the envelope in the mail
and then we'll change the way in which we call
the function:
 inviteToParty (friend = Hank)
 inviteToParty (friend = Ann)
 inviteToParty (friend = Alicia)
 inviteToParty (friend = Whitney)
 inviteToParty (friend = Greg)
 inviteToParty (friend = Mi Young)
 inviteToParty (friend = Flavio)
 inviteToParty (friend = Brian)
Now, each time we call the function, friend is a
different person, and each of our eight friends will be invited.
We've just reduced the number of lines of pseudo-code from 40 to 13 by
using a function, and our code became much easier to read. (We also
got rid of that bug whereby Flavio received an empty envelope.)
All of the examples on this page were written in pseudo-code, but the
next page describes how to write functions in C++.
Summary
Think of a function as a black box.
 
A "black box" is a convenient analogy for something that
happens by magic. How does the black box work? It takes
some inputs, and swirls them around inside the box, and
produces some kind of output. Each function can 
swirl around the inputs in a different way, however
that function so chooses. How a function will use
the inputs to come up with the outputs is the
essence of the function.
We just said that functions are like black boxes because
we throw in some inputs, and something happens by magic,
and some output comes flying out. The black box metaphor
is really only appropriate when you are using other
people's functions. When you write the function
yourself, you have to know exactly how the function
swirls up the inputs. It's not magical for you, because
you decided how the function works. However, if you give
your function to someone else for them to use, you can
tell them it's a black box.
