 June 
 17, 2002 - The source code is now available! Download 
 now 
 
 
 
 May 
 10, 2002 - Sybase has informed SciTech that they 
 have chosen the Open 
 Source License to be used and are curretnly awaiting 
 OSI approval.
 
 
 
 September 27, 2001 
 - The final version of the Watcom11.0c binary patch 
 beta is now available for download. 
 
 
 
 June 
 29, 2001 - After lots of discussion and hard work 
 between SciTech and Sybase legal, we are close to the 
 final version of the license agreement for the 11.0c binary 
 patch release! Hopefully we can wrap up the first beta 
 release of the 11.0c binaries and release them for testing 
 soon. On the Open Source license front, SciTech is actively 
 discussing with Sybase the choice of license to be used. 
 
 
 
 February 22, 2001 - Watcom C/C++ and Fortran 11.0c 
 are now building! After months of working with the source 
 code and coming to better understand the build system, 
 the team has finally completed the step of getting a clean 
 build of the Watcom 11.0c binaries. We have done some 
 tests on the 11.0c compiler binaries and everything appears 
 to be in working order. Right now we are working on determining 
 which files will be distributed in the 11.0c web update 
 patch, and building the ZIP and Windows installation archives. 
 
 
 
 October 3, 2000 - All source code has been checked 
 into our new Perforce software depot, and developers are 
 getting connected and familiar with the Perforce environment. 
 Most developers on the team have received a copy of the 
 source code along with access to perforce, although some 
 as still waiting for final license agreements to be approved 
 by Sybase. Progress is slow as everyone comes to terms 
 with the vast amount of source code and the complicated 
 build system. We hope to soon have the source code building 
 correctly within the new source control environment.
