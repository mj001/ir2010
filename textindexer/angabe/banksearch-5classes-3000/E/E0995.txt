Release: 
gcc version 2.7.2.3 (also with Code Sourcery compilation server as of 20001209)
 
Organization: 
 
Environment: 
Debian GNU/Linux (slink); x86
 
Description: 
When you compile the following code with -c -O -Wall -g,
the warning messages include:
7: warning: char format, double arg (arg 2)
for the line
printf("%s", &d);
I find this warning misleading; I would prefer:
warning: char* format, double* arg (arg 2)
 
File Attachments: 
 
How-To-Repeat: 
#include 
void foo() {
 double d;
 printf("%c", d);
 printf("%s", &d);
 printf("%c", &d);
 printf("%s", d);
}

 The problem is that the code for printing type names when format checking
 tries to be too clever about working out the names to use and deciding
 that types are the same from their names when it had already decided that
 they were different types. This leads to various other oddities with
 messages referring to "different type arg" when they could be more
 precise.
 
 The C++ front end includes general support for producing a name for an
 arbitrary type in diagnostics with the %T format specifier in cp_error,
 cp_pedwarn etc.. What's needed to fix this problem properly is for the C
 front end to get something along the lines of what the C++ front end has
 for formatting types; then the actual argument type could be formatted
 with %T. (Adding these capabilities to the C front end could probably
 also lead to better diagnostics in various other places.)

 I've already put in the necessary machinery for so doing in
 diagnostics.*. What remains to be done is to replace error_with_decl()
 and warning_with_decl() to error() and warning() (maybe error_at())
 with use of those specifiers. That was planed but I didn't get the
 chance to finish the work. Already on my TODO list but I would love
 to assist any taker.

 What's also needed for the present PR is for the code in cp/error.c for
 formatting types to move to common code where C can use it as well. (I'd
 guess that most of it can probably be shared, though stylistic differences
 such as "int*" for C++ versus "int *" for C should be allowed for. Or, a
 version covering only C types might be a lot simpler.) The existing code
 in c-lang.c
 
 case 'D':
 case 'F':
 case 'T':
 {
 const char *n = DECL_NAME (t)
 ? (*decl_printable_name) (t, 2)
 : "({anonymous})";
 output_add_string (buffer, n);
 }
 return 1;
 
 along with the default decl_printable_name / decl_name doesn't seem
 adequate for even the simple case of this PR (where a name for a pointer
 type should be constructed).

 Certainly. In C++ we tend to systematically print scopes and such.
 But it is true that all those differences can be parameterized through
 call-backs. The codes in cp/error.c are still under development
 (although there has been no visible activity about them).
 In the long run cp_error() and cp_warning() are supposed to killed in
 favor of error() and warning().

 Do you see a better short term solution?

 No. I don't think this PR is release-critical, so fixing it can wait
 until the diagnostics support for type names is shared between C and C++.
