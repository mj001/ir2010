 mktime()
 
 
mktime-Convert the broken-down time to a time_t value
Synopsis
 #include &#060;time.h&#062;
 t = mktime(ts);
 time_t t; /* number of seconds since 1/1/70 */
 struct tm *ts; /* broken down time structure */
Description
 This function converts the broken-down time, expressed as local
 time, to a time_t value identical to what the time function would
 return for the specified date and time.
 The functions localtime , gmtime , ctime , and mktime share a
 static data area. A call to any one of these destroys the
 results of the previous call.
Returns
 The mktime function returns the number of seconds since January 1,
 1970.
Example
 /*
 *
 * Get a time value for a very important event
 * Sept 8, 1988 20:16:02
 *
 */
 #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
 #include &#060;time.h&#062;
 void main(void)
 {
 struct tm inputtm;
 time_t event;
 inputtm.tm_sec = 02; /* seconds after the minute */
 inputtm.tm_min = 16; /* minutes after the hour */
 inputtm.tm_hour = 20; /* hours since midnight */
 inputtm.tm_mday = 8; /* day of the month */
 inputtm.tm_mon = 9; /* months since January */
 inputtm.tm_year = 88; /* years since 1900 */
 inputtm.tm_isdst = 1; /* Daylight Savings Time flag */
 event = mktime(&inputtm);
 printf("%d seconds passed between 1/1/70, 00:00:00"
 " and 9/8/88, 20:16:02n", event);
