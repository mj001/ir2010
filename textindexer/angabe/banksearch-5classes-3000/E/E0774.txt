The Watcom compiler has a number of advantages of other free compilers, such as full support for 16-bit DOS and Windows development, powerful commercial level debugger with full remote debugging capabilities (serial, parallel, NetBIOS, TCP/IP etc). The Watcom compiler has always been known as producing some of the fastest code around, and even today the Watcom C/C++ 11.0b product produces code as good as the best comercial compilers available. The Watcom C/C++ compiler is also the only freely available compiler for 16-bit Windows and OS/2 device driver development.
