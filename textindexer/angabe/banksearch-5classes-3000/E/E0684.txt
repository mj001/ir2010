 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>Why are you ending the Visual C++ Subscription program? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Over the last two and a half years, the Visual C++ Subscription program has delivered six releases of Visual C++®. During this time, Microsoft learned a lot about what it means to deliver professional developer tools with this frequency, including how rapidly developers are able to integrate new development environments into their projects. We received clear feedback that many developers are unable to take full advantage of the frequent updates. In response to this feedback, Microsoft has decided to return to a more conventional upgrade cycle, discontinuing the subscription program under the terms of the end user license agreement for Visual C++ 4.0.
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	
 
 
 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>How strong is Microsoft’s commitment to Visual C++ in view of this ending of the subscription program? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
Microsoft is fully committed to Visual C++ as the tool of choice when developing the highest performance Windows®-based applications and components. Microsoft continues to be a leading participant in the ANSI/ISO standardization committees working toward standardization of the C++ language. The Visual C++ 5.0 launch is the largest in the product’s history. Visual C++ is a crucial component of the development tools offering from Microsoft, now and in the foreseeable future.

 Q. 
 
 
 <![if ! IE]>What version of Visual C++ should I obtain, now that Visual C++ Subscription is no longer available? <![endif]>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A. 
 
 
	
In general, you should obtain Visual C++ 5.0 Professional Edition. Contact your local reseller for information about pricing and availability. If you work extensively with databases (particularly with Microsoft SQL Server&#153;), you may want to obtain Visual C++ Enterprise Edition. If you just want to learn Visual C++, the Learning Edition offers excellent value.
