Allegro Tutorial
 
This tutorial requires an understanding of C, provided 
 in the previous tutorial. This teaches the beginnings of using the Allegro 
 library. Once a basic understanding is achieved, using the library is 
 as simple as reading the library docs, which is what I learned from, and 
 learned very well. Allegro is one of the best documented libs I have ever 
 seen. And it is for this reason that this tutorial will be fairly short. 
 The real learning will come from the next tutorial on how to use Allegro 
 in a game.
 
How is this more than restating the manual? Well basically 
 a lot of areas are pieced together where they need to be. The bulk of 
 new info comes from the Learning Allegro section, which basically are 
 random tips of what to learn, and things I don't feel the documentation 
 covers well or points out.
 
This tutorial applies to the latest Allegro 4.0.0.
 
The latest Allegro library needs to be installed, and 
 can be found at: http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/

Starting Allegro
 
First thing is to include the header file:
 #include 
 
Before doing anything with Allegro, you must initalize it:
 
alleg_init();
 
Before initializing other functions, it is best to setup the current 
 .CFG file, which is created by Allegro's included setup program, or by 
 your program. It defaults to allegro.cfg, but if you want to change it 
 to the name of your application/game, use this command:
 
set_config_file("myapp.cfg");
 
If you want timing functions, or use the mouse/music/movies/etc which 
 require the timing functions, install the timer. This is very important 
 to keep your program running the same speed on all computers.
 
install_timer();
 
Next if you want to install the keyboard, do so now:
 
install_keyboard();
 
While Allegro has the keyboard, none of the C library commands will work 
 on the keyboard.
 
Next step is installing the mouse, if needed, returns 0 on error (no 
 buttons):
 
int buttons = install_mouse();
 
This returns the number of buttons on the mouse. The left button is #0, 
 right is #1, and middle button is #2. This is important when detecting 
 which button is pressed.
 
If you want the joystick, install it (returns non-zero on error):
 if (install_joystick(JOY_TYPE_AUTODETECT)) {
 allegro_message("Joystick Error: %s", allegro_error);
 return 1; //exit to DOS
}
 
All of the different joysticks are listed in the Allegro docs, but autodetect 
 will pull info from the .CFG file if loaded, or it will pick a generic 
 joystick type. Allegro_error is a global char* which contains an error 
 message from most functions when they give an error.
 
If you want sound drivers, install them now:
 if(install_sound(DIGI_AUTODETECT, MIDI_AUTODETECT, NULL)) {
 allegro_message("Sound Error: %s", allegro_error);
 return 1;
}
 
If you don't want sound or MIDI music, replace the driver name with DIGI_NONE 
 or MIDI_NONE, respectively. The NULL parameter refers to a char*, which 
 was an old feature in Allegro, and is only there for compatability now. 
 Nothing you put in there will have any effect. At this time you may also 
 wish to set the volume levels, which could come from the .CFG file (this 
 discussed later in the tutorial):
 
set_volume(255, 255); //digital and 
 music to max levels
 
The last thing you do is initialize graphics. This is because the other 
 functions will output text mode errors, which cannot be displayed in graphics 
 mode. Another good reason for this is that if a problem occurs, video 
 is most likely the incompatable part.
 
The first thing to do is set the color depth, and the screen size. I 
 strongly recommend that the screen size be placed in 
 constants in alleg.h or some global include file -- this has the advantage 
 of being able to change these 2 constants and never having to change any 
 code, and the application will adjust, if you base all your calculations 
 on these constants, so you can have on-the-fly resolution changes.
 set_color_depth(8); //256 color mode (8 bits mode)
//in a global file, scrx is: const int scrx = 640;
//in a global file, scry is: const int srcy = 480;
if (set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, scrx, scry, 0, 0) {
 printf("Video Error: %s", allegro_error); //screen would still be in text mode on error
 return 1;
}
 
You could also support multiple screen modes (for example if a card didn't 
 support a certain resolution or color depth) by nesting if statements 
 like the one above, to test all acceptable modes.
 
Now Allegro is set up and ready to go. Remember to add the line END_OF_MAIN() 
 right after your main functions ending brace.

The Allegro documentation is written so 
 well that it would be hopelessly redundant trying to write a tutorial 
 for all of its hundreds of functions. So basically this section here is 
 some Allegro tips on where to start playing around with Allegro and what 
 methods I found to be good, and what I found that sucked. More advanced 
 issues working with Allegro are in the game tutorial.
 
The first thing to do for learning Allegro is getting some cool graphics 
 and musics off the net to play around with. Then try making a few small 
 projects with Allegro, such as:
 
A ball screensaver project -- create a bouncing ball, start with a drawn 
 circle, then move to a .bmp file of a better ball (perhaps a beach ball) 
 and bounce that. If you want to expand the project some more, have a MIDI 
 file play in the background, or have a sound effect (.wav file) when the 
 ball hits the sides. If you want to get really fancy, add in some keyboard 
 controls and gravity to the ball and let the user "nudge" the 
 ball in directions, using geometric vectors, sin and cos to calculate 
 the position.
 
Allegro Tips
 A few random raves that the Allegro docs don't 
 cover, plus what to waste your time on, and what to certainly not even 
 try. . .
 
I see sooooo many Allegro programmers not using these features and they 
 are the best in there, espically from a user point of view. Use datafiles 
 whenever you can. There is nothing more annoying to me than having 100s 
 of little .BMP files taking up valuable slack space on the hard drive, 
 slowing it down. Datafiles are compressed and can knock those .BMPs to 
 1/4 of their size! Plus it's a lot faster to program since they load into 
 an array -- no need to type in all the filenames into load_bitmap()!
 
Also on this issue, use the packfile functions to read and save everything 
 you do (with the exception of .CFG files of course.) They take no time 
 to learn since they perfectly emulate the C-style file functions, and 
 give all the benefits of compressed data.
 
Although this is a very controversial subject in today's Pentium II and 
 Pentium III world, fixed numbers might be something to consider when using 
 them in a game, where floating accuracy is not needed. This has the advantage 
 of using integer math. If you ever plan to run your game on a 486, definately 
 use these, and also fixed point is very friendly to old (pre-Athlon)AMD 
 and Cyrix processors. On the latest processors, though, double precision 
 floating point variables were tested to be faster than fixed point (see 
 fixtest.cpp for the test results). Also Allegro 
 fixed point trig is fairly inaccurate and is noticeable over a distance 
 of more than 200 pixels or so. I recommend using double type variables 
 if you are planning on running the program on "today's" computers.
 
I've never used the 3D routines on Allegro. I would think you would be 
 wasting your time. If you really want to do 3D, move to Windows and do 
 Direct3D and OpenGL. The only good reason I could see for doing this would 
 be to make some simple 3D rotating logo perhaps on the title screen or 
 something small like that. I wouldn't base an application off the 3D functions. 
 I suggest the Allegro GL library which you can find on http://allegro.cc 
 as a library extension.
 
I would say the same thing about GUI. If you look at the GUI in my Project 
 V2143 game, you will see that it looks nice, but I will warn you that 
 I've spend literally 3x as much time on that GUI as I did on the game. 
 I could probably do it in Windows in 1/4 of the time. If you want a GUI-heavy 
 application, use Windows. It's not worth the trouble. I really should 
 have made the map editor in Windows. . . Learn from my mistake.
 
RLE sprites and compiled sprites are usually not worth the trouble, since 
 their speed boost is exteremely small. This boost may increase on lower 
 class machines, but I haven't seen any yet.
 
Read the FAQ on making screenshots. For some reason I've seen a lot of 
 Allegro programmers saying they can't do screenshots yet. It's just a 
 simple one-line statement that works anywhere anytime:
 
save_bitmap("screen.pcx", BUFFER, pal);
 
Where BUFFER is the BITMAP* to your double buffer, and pal is the current 
 pallete (use a dummy pallette if in truecolor mode.) Even if you aren't 
 double buffering you can still save the screen.
 
And by the way, a final note about the BUFFER. Usually you don't draw 
 directly to the screen. Use a technique like double buffering where you 
 draw everything to a buffer then draw the buffer to the screen to eliminate 
 flicker and increase speed. Dirty rectangles is also a good variation 
 of double buffering which draws only changed areas to the screen.

Sample Code
 
This sample program was made and tested under both MSVC and DJGPP using 
 the latest Allegro WIP as of 7/9/00. It displays Hello World!!! in the 
 middle of the screen in yellow with a blue background then waits for a 
 keypress. Many other examples can be found in Allegro's examples directory.
 
If you have seen Allegro 3.1 you may notice some differences from the 
 code you are used to seeing. The function allegro_message works like printf 
 but works under environments like Windows in the form of a pop-up box, 
 since they have no default text output. In GUI environments the set_window_title 
 function sets the window's title.
 
Each hicolor and truecolor depth is tested since different cards support 
 different depths. For example my Voodoo3 card supports 24 but not 32 in 
 VESA but 32 and not 24 under Windows. 15 and 16 bit color depths have 
 roughly the same amount of colors and 24 and 32 bit color depths have 
 the same amount of colors. The makecol function takes red, green, and 
 blue components to form a color. See the Allegro documentation for detailed 
 explanations of all of these functions.
 #include 
const int scrx = 640;
const int scry = 480;
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
 if (allegro_init()) {
 allegro_message("Cannot initalize Allegro.\n");
 return 1;
 }
 //Set the window title when in a GUI environment
 set_window_title("Hello World");
 if (install_keyboard()) {
 allegro_message("Cannot initalize keyboard input.\n");
 return 1;
 }
 //set graphics mode, trying all acceptable depths
 set_color_depth(32);
 if (set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, scrx, scry, 0, 0)) {
 set_color_depth(24);
 if (set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, scrx, scry, 0, 0)) {
 set_color_depth(16);
 if (set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, scrx, scry, 0, 0)) {
 set_color_depth(15);
 if (set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, scrx, scry, 0, 0)) {
 allegro_message("Video Error: %s.\n", allegro_error);
 return 1;
 }
 }
 }
 }
 //set text background color to bright blue
 text_mode(makecol(0, 0, 255));
 //prints yellow "Hello World!!!" in middle of screen
 textout_centre(screen, font, "Hello World!!!", scrx/2,
 scry/2, makecol(255, 255, 0));
 //Wait for a key to be pressed
 while (!keypressed()) {}
 return 0;
 //Allegro will automatically deinitalize itself on exit
}
END_OF_MAIN()

Using Microsoft Visual C++ 
 with Allegro
 
I wrote these instructions using MSVC 6.0, and probably work for other 
 MSVC versions too. This section assumes you have never seen MSVC before.
 
The first thing is to get Allegro installed. Follow the instructions 
 in the Allegro package (at the time of writing, the readme.vc file).
 
Once Allegro is setup you will want to try to create new Allegro programs 
 or port your Allegro 3.x programs to the new WIP, and to do this you will 
 want to create a new project.
 
In the file menu, select new, then click projects tab, select Win32 application, 
 and in the project name box type in the name for your new project. If 
 you wish you may change the location of the created directory in the Location 
 box. Press the OK button.
 
Note for those porting their old projects: it is not 
 necessary for the source code to be in that same directory -- for example 
 if you are working on a project that you want both DOS and Windows executables 
 and you started it in DJGPP, you could leave your source code in the DJGPP 
 directory so both DJGPP and MSVC share the same code, and what you change 
 in MSVC changes in the DJGPP version and vice versa.
 
The next window will ask what kind of application to you want. Select 
 "An empty project" then press the finish button.
 
If you do not have any source files to add (from a previous Allegro project 
 you wish to port to Windows), select the new option from the file menu. 
 Select the files tab. From here you can create C++ source and header files, 
 as well as other files which you will probably not create while using 
 Allegro. To create a file select the appropiate file from the list on 
 the left, type in a file name, and press OK. By default the file will 
 be added to your newly created project
 
If you are porting a program and already have the source code, you can 
 add your code in the Project menu. Select Add To Project > Files, then 
 locate your source files and add them. Remember you can drag a box and 
 use the shift to select multiple files just like other Windows file dialogs. 
 You should add all of your C/C++ source files and your headers as well. 
 Although adding the headers is not required, adding them makes it easy 
 to click on the file in the project to edit it. You can add any other 
 file type as well, for example a readme.txt file or a Word document, for 
 quick editing.
 
The left pane has the class view, which when you add your C++ files you 
 can get a chart of all your classes and their data members and methods 
 which you can double click to see/edit, a very valuable feature when using 
 C++. You can click the tabs below to see files, resources, and a help 
 window. Click on the FileView tab to see the source you added. Use the 
 above tree to navigate the files in your project -- double click to edit.
 
If you are porting your program from Allegro 3.x, there are a few changes 
 you need to make, which are mentioned in the Allegro documentation. Once 
 you make these changes your program will compile under any compiler supported 
 by Allegro.
 
Once you have your source code in MSVC, you will want to set up your 
 project to compile for Allegro. In the project menu select settings. In 
 the Settings For box make sure Win32 Debug is selected. Make sure your 
 project's name is highlighted in the tree box below by clicking on it, 
 then click on the Link tab. In the Object/library modules textbox add 
 "alld.lib" to the end of the list (do not type the quotes). 
 Lastly, change the Settings For box to Win32 Release and add "alleg.lib" 
 to the end of the Object/library modules list and press OK.
 
To compile your program press the build button on the toolbar (shortcut 
 F7). The message window at the bottom will show any errors and warnings 
 -- double click on a line to be shown the error to be fixed. After all 
 errors are fixed press the build again until the EXE builds (It will show 
 0 errors and warnings if it worked). To run your program press the the 
 execute button which looks like an exclaimation point (shortcut Shift-F5) 
 to run the program. If you want to run the program in debugging mode press 
 the button next to it, the "Go" button (shortcut F5). Common 
 debugging functions are shown on the debugging menu.
 
NOTE: The MSVC debugger cannot be used if your program 
 is running in full-screen DirectX mode. Change your graphics driver to 
 GFX_DIRECTX_WIN or GFX_DIRECTX_OVL if your card supports it, else use 
 GFX_GDI which is unfortunately much slower. You obviously will also need 
 to have your desktop in a higher resolution than your game if you intend 
 to see other windows.
 
After your program is complete and you want to distribute it, you will 
 want to compile the program in release mode. Note that release mode only 
 works on the Professional and Enterprise editions of MSVC; MSVC standard 
 does not have an optimizer and only runs in debugging mode. In the Build 
 menu pick "Set Active Configuration" and pick the release mode 
 for your project and rebuild your project as before. You will find the 
 release and debug EXE files in the Release and Debug directories in your 
 main project's directory.
