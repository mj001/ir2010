 3.1 PHP Installation on Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/2000
PHP is IMMENSELY POPULAR on Microsoft Windows platform and is surprisingly 
more popular than Microsoft's own ASP web scripting language!! A major reason
for popularity is that PHP is a object oriented scripting language whereas ASP is not.
PHP has a large collection of re-usable classes (objects).
PHP runs lot faster than ASP on MS Windows and has more features and functionalities
than Microsoft ASP.
PHP is much more robust, reliable and powerful than ASP.
And the user base of PHP is extremely large because PHP runs on MS Windows,
Linux, Mac OS and all UNIX'es.
Greatest advantage of
PHP is that you can develop on MS Windows and deploy on Linux or UNIX and vice versa!!
There are more PHP users under MS Windows98/NT/2000 than on any other operating system!!
Because there is so much demand for PHP on MS Windows 98/NT/2000, a ready to 
install executable is made and you simply double-click on the exe file to 
automatically install PHP in just 2 minutes. Download the PHP executable 
install file from

 3.2 Apache Webserver Quick-Install (10 seconds) on Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/2000
You need a web-server to run the PHP on MS Windows. You can use MS IIS web server
or you can use free Apache web-server for MS Windows 95/98/NT/2000. To save you 
lot of time here is the ready-to-install setup.exe file for apache
for Windows platform:
PHPTriad which is Apache+PHP+MySQL single package is at 
http://www.phpgeek.com/phptriad.php
and at 
mirrorsite.
I very strongly recommend PHPTriad as it is immensely popular among MS Windows
users (millions of downloads).

3.3 SQL server for Microsoft 
SQL server can be on a seperate box which need not be running MS Windows.
You also need a SQL server for doing web development. I recommend that you
install Redhat Linux on a very old PC like (Pentium or 486 box) and install the
PostgreSQL
RPMs on it. You do not need any windows graphics for a database server
and at console mode startup the 
PostgreSQL
server. 
PostgreSQL
is about 3 times 
faster than Oracle or MS SQL server. 
The PostgreSQL support code for PHP was written by Adam Sussman

3.4 ASP To PHP Converter - Migration From ASP2PHP
After installing PHP, you may want to migrate all the Microsoft ASP programs
to PHP. See the chapter 
ASP2PHP.
 3.5 PHP Installation on UNIX'es and others
See the installation guide and instructions at 
PHP main site 
http://www.php.net or INSTALL file
in the downloaded package itself.
 3.6 PHP Installation on Apple Macintosh
Apple Macintosh is Unix like operating system. And actually it's father is FreeBSD.
It picked up many titbits from other Unices and is quite powerful OS.
See the Unix history at 
Unix Family Tree
and click on the item 12 to see the Apple Mac position 
at 
Apple Mac tree.
The installation and use of PHP on Apple Mac will be very similar to that of on Unix OS.
