 Wireless video just got a lot easier with the XCam2, a video camera that can transmit LIVE
 COLOR video up to 100 feet. The XCam2 integrates a color analog video camera and 2.4-GHz transmitter into a single device that is smaller than a golf ball. You can add multiple cameras and scan between the cameras like changing channels on your TV! Learn
 more about how it works.
 So
 tiny it fits anywhere! What do you want to see?
 
 
 
- front door - who's knocking?
 
- baby's nursery - is she still asleep?
 
- backyard - who's prowling around?
 
- den - is your spouse still working?
 
- pool - are the kids playing safely? (more
 uses)
 
 
 Sets up
 in only 5 minutes! Easy to Use!
 Because the camera is wireless, simply place a camera in any area you want
 to watch over. Plug the Video Receiver into your TV! The signal is
 automatically sent to your TV (or VCR if you want to record the
 action).

By: S. Vallabhan 
 I have just set up the wireless x10 cam two days ago. What a great buy!!! I can't believe the picture quality, color, range ability and tiny size! I'm amazed that it cost so little. I have been on a quest to find a camera that does not need its own monitor because that is what jacks the price up and the cameras that don't require a monitor have bad picture quality and don't come in color. They cost twice as much also. I can now afford to get two more cameras for my sisters who are alone all day. Safety seems to be a luxury that most people can't afford. I am so grateful to X10 for the prices and the Free Shipping for orders over $49.99. Thanks for your contribution to public safety!!

 ...Let me start by saying I am very impressed by your site, your company and your products. I ordered an X10 Camera last week (on a Tuesday) and by Friday it had been delivered to my Postal Pickup Station. My order had been received, processed and shipped in the time it takes most companies to acknowledge receipt of an order. The order was received well packaged and I was setting up in minutes and the product (an X10 Camera) is functioning better than expected. The addition of
 the FREE VCR Commander impressed me as well...

With
 the amazing XRay Vision software 
 (FREE Download) software and USB Converter you can view live COLOR 
 video from your XCam2 cameras on your PC. And you can use a
 "remote" PC, like your office PC, to check on your home via the Internet. XRay Vision can e-mail fresh images to you (or update a website) at timely intervals (10 seconds - 2 hours) - so you don't need the software loaded on your office (remote) PC. Unlike other
 webcams, you can monitor any room within 100ft of your computer! Other webcams require a cable connected to your PC so you can only monitor the room with the PC! Also, unlike other
 webcams, you do NOT need to have a webserver, all you need is an internet account!
 Normally sold for $70, add to 3 Camera Deal for only $59.99. More Information on XRay Vision, click here.
