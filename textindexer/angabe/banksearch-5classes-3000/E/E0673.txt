Section 1.3: A Brief History of C++
The C++ Programming Language is basically an extension of the 
C Programming Language. The C Programming language was developed 
from 1969-1973 at Bell labs, at the same time the UNIX operating
system was being developed there. C was a direct descendant of the
language B, which was developed by Ken Thompson as a systems
programming language for the fledgling UNIX operating system.
B, in turn, descended from the language BCPL which was designed 
in the 1960s by Martin Richards while at MIT.
In 1971 Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs extended the B language 
(by adding types) into what he called NB, for "New B".
Ritchie credits some of his changes to language constructs found
in Algol68, although he states
"although it [the type scheme], perhaps, did not emerge in a form 
that Algol's adherents would approve of"
After restructuring the language and rewriting the compiler for B,
Ritchie gave his new language a name: "C".
 In 1983, with various versions of C floating around the 
computer world, ANSI established a committee that eventually 
published a standard for C in 1989. 
In 1983 Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs created C++.
C++ was designed for the UNIX system environment, it
represents an enhancement of the C programming
language and enables programmers to improve the
quality of code produced, thus making reusable code
easier to write.
