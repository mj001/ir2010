What's Wrong With This Code? Volume #3
The hidden danger of overriding virtual pascal base functions
To help you debug the program, put a breakpoint in the CreateParams method of TForm2. Place another
breakpoint on the line where m_WndClassName is initialized in the constructor. The red text in the code below
shows where to place the breakpoints. Then run the program and see which breakpoint gets tripped first.
//---------------------------------------------------------------
// form cpp file
__fastcall TForm2::TForm2(TComponent* Owner,
 const AnsiString &WndClassName)
 : TForm(Owner),
 m_WndClassName(WndClassName)
{
}
//---------------------------------------------------------------
void __fastcall TForm2::CreateParams(TCreateParams & Params)
{
 TForm::CreateParams(Params);
 strcpy(Params.WinClassName,m_WndClassName.c_str());
}
You may be suprised to find that the breakpoint in CreateParams gets tripped before the breakpoint on
m_WndClassName. How can that be? That's not possible! CreateParams is a virtual function, and
virtual functions are not supposed to get called before an object is fully constructed. How does CreateParams
get called before the form's constructor runs?
To investigate the problem, it is helpful to look at the call stack from the breakpoint in CreateParams.
Figure 2 shows the call stack on my system.
 
Figure 2. call stack as viewed from CreateParams
Notice the three lines that are highlighted. At the bottom of the call stack window is the button click event of the
main form (there is some stuff on the call stack below that, but we don't need to worry about that). The button
click event constructs a TForm2 object, so we see the TForm2 constructor on the call stack.
The TForm2 constructor immediately passes control to the base class constructor. As we move up the stack, we can see the base
class constructors for TForm and TCustomForm. Moving closer to the top of the stack, we begin to
reach some calls that have to do with creating the window handle for the form. These functions are called
HandleNeeded, CreateHandle, and CreateWnd. We eventually reach CreateParams at the
top of the call stack. It looks like CreateParams is called by the CreateWnd method of
TWinControl. We can verify this by looking at the VCL source in CONTROLS.PAS.
procedure TWinControl.CreateWnd;
var
 Params: TCreateParams;
 TempClass: TWndClass;
 ClassRegistered: Boolean;
begin
 CreateParams(Params);
 ...
end;
The call stack reveals that CreateWnd is called from the base constructors
of the form, and CreateWnd calls CreateParams. Here is the crux of the problem. CreateParams
is a virtual function. In pure C++, you are not supposed to call virtual functions from the constructors of a base
class. Well, that's not entirely correct. You can call them, but if a derived class overrides that function, the derived
version of the function doesn't get called. This makes sense because you don't want to execute methods of a class before
its constructor has had a chance to run.
Object Pascal, on the other hand, is a different beast. Calling virtual functions from base class constructors is
perfectly legal. If a derived class overrides a virtual function that is called by the base constructor, then
the virtual method of the derived class will execute before the base constructor has returned control to
the derived constructor. This is a dangerous scenario. What if the virtual function accesses an object that
gets created in the constructor? An access violation will occur because the member object hasn't been initialized yet.
Because C++Builder sits on top of a pascal foundation, your C++ forms, datamodules, and controls must play along with
this oddity in object pascal. The behavior of virtual functions in object pascal explains why the CreateParams
method was running before the constructor for TForm2 had a chance to run.
At this point, the problem should be coming into focus. The m_WndClassName string variable is initialized from
the constructor of TForm2. This initialization does not occur until the base class constructor returns. The
base class constructor calls CreateParams. CreateParams attempts to use the value of the string
in m_WndClassName. But hold on a minute, m_WndClassName hasn't been initialized yet! We are still
inside the base class constuctor, but CreateParams is trying to access a member variable that doesn't get
initialized until the base constructor returns. As a result, m_WndClassName doesn't contain the string
that we expect it to contain. When we copy m_WndClassName into the Params structure, we end up
copying an empty string.
The empty string turns out to be the cause of the error. A window cannot have an empty window class name. When we try
to create the window, the operating system returns an error. The VCL transforms this error into the
EWin32Error that we see via the message box.
So now that we know the cause of the error, how do we fix it? Fortunately, the code is not really worth fixing. I can't
think of a reason why we would want to initialize the window class name of a form from code that is outside the form's
class. Usually, that sort of thing is initalized internally. Nevertheless, it is worth discussing how we might solve
the problem. One way would be to use a static method and a static variable. Another method would be to have
TForm2 call a method of the main form to retrieve the class name. A third technique would be to create a
utility class that dishes out class names. TForm2 could execute a method of this object to fetch its class
name. None of these solutions sound that appetizing.
Instead of worrying about how to fix the code in this edition of w3TC, I think we should look at some of the
implications of how object pascal deals with virtual functions. First of all, the normal rules of C++ don't always
apply to C++Builder. This is just great. It's hard enough to memorize how C++ works, let alone trying to remember where
and when C++Builder deviates from normal C++ behavior. Secondly, you have to be aware of what virtual functions are called
by the base class constructors of your form. CreateWnd and CreateParams are two of them, but there
might be others. If you override these functions, you must be careful not to access any member variables from the virtual
function. Third, you should realize that the same strange behavior applies to destructors. If you override a virtual
function and a pascal base class desctructor calls that function, your derived function will indeed execute. This is
silly in my opinion, and it's a recipe for disaster. Pure C++ does not behave this way. Lastly, you should also realize
that this behavior of object pascal plagues Delphi programmers too. I could convert the orignial code to Delphi, and
the result would have been the same. The only difference with Delphi is that Object Pascal allows you to initialize
variables before calling the base class constructor. 
Note: When CreateParams attempts to use the contents of the string member variable, the string
appears to be empty. This was a stroke of luck. There are no guarantees about what an unitialized variable will
contain. The internal data for the string could have contained garbage. When I first tested the code, I was
actually expecting an access violation.
Note: In this issue, we saw how C++Builder breaks from C++ tradition when you derive a class from a pascal base.
What happens when you don't derive from pascal classes? If you derive from a C++ base class, and it calls a virtual
function in its constructor, will the derived version of the function execute? This question is left as an exercise.
Note: It appears that we have found a clear deficiency in the object pascal language. Now, let's ask ourselves
how Borland should fix the problem. Yes, it is bad that certain functions
in your class might execute before your constructor has run, or after your destructor has run. But what is the best
way to remedy the problem?
One solution would be to delay the creation of the form's window handle until after the constructor has finished.
This is how OWL worked. In OWL, after the constructor of your window had finished, you still didn't have a real window
handle yet. The problem with this approach is that the
Handle property of the form would not be available in the constructor of the form. You would not be able to
set the Height and Width properties of the form in the constructor if this was the case. Furthermore, none of your
child controls would be real controls yet either. You would not be able to set the Text property of an edit box from
the form's constructor, because the edit box wouldn't be a real windows control at that point.
Another solution would be to change object pascal so it behaves exactly like C++. If a base class constructor calls
a virtual function, then don't execute the derived version of the function. This causes problems too. A lot of
the VCL classes override CreateWnd and CreateParams. If object pascal behaved like C++, then
CreateWnd and CreateParams would cease being called, except for the functions in TWinControl.
This would completely break the VCL.
At this point, there doesn't seem to be a clear cut way for Borland to make the situation any better than it is now.
Perhaps the best course of action is to simply memorize which virtual functions are called during construction, and
to remember not to access member variables of the class when you override those functions.
