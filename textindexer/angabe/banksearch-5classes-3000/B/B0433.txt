 (representing overall limit of savings with the Society for each individual).

 16 days of opening your account you decide that this account is not suitable 
 for you, if you write to us and advise us of this we will arrange to return

 will not be returned to the account holder(s) until investment cheques 
 have cleared. 
 
Interest
 
11. The interest 
 rates payable on your account are variable and we may change the rate 
 of interest at any time for any valid reason.

 at the earliest opportunity but at least within 3 working days of the 
 change:
 (i) by general notice in our branches;
 (ii) by notice in newspapers of our choice. The newspapers we usually 
 use are the Express and Star and Dudley News Group showing our previous 
 and new interest rates.
 Annually we will send you a statement of interest rates paid during the 
 year (unless your account balance is below £100).
 13. You can find out what interest rates apply to your account at anytime 
 by contacting any of our Branches or Head Office on (01384) 231414.
 14. Interest will be payable after deduction of income tax at the rate 
 required by law.
 15. Receipts into your account will earn interest from the day of receipt 
 to your account.
 16. Interest is calculated on a daily basis up to the day of withdrawal. 
 If you require an explanation of how your interest is calculated please 
 ask your local branch or contact Head Office. A written explanation will 
 be posted to you within a few days of your request.

 provide sufficient information for this transmission. In the event of 
 insufficient information, interest will be credited to the account.
 18. Interest will be paid annually on the 31st March.

 £5,000, £10,000 and £25,000.
 
Availability

20. A cheque 
 drawn on a Dudley Building Society account will not be stopped.

 until up to 14 days have elapsed.

 from the date they are received by the Society.

 of up to £500 in cash each day or a greater amount by cheque providing 
 you have the funds in your account.

 and for each individual who is a signatory to the account will be required 
 before an account is opened.

 notify us promptly if your name or address changes. Any notice of change

 without individually notifying each account holder.
 
Passbook
 
28. We will 
 provide you with a passbook, but it will remain our property and must 
 be returned to us on request. Your passbook must be forwarded to us, at 
 such times as we may decide, to be brought up to date or for such other 
 purposes as we may require.
 29. Your passbook must accompany any withdrawal and any further investment.
 30. If your passbook has an entry which seems to be wrong, you should 
 tell us as soon as possible so we can resolve matters.
 31. You must immediately notify us by contacting any of our Branches or 
 Head Office on (01384) 231414 if you discover that your passbook is missing. 
 You must then confirm this in writing.
 After you have provided such evidence regarding the loss, and given any 
 indemnity and paid such fee (if any) which we may require, we may transfer 
 the amount in the account to a replacement passbook after seven days have 
 elapsed. If someone other than you, produces your passbook to us, pretends 
 to be you or to be authorised by you, and is therefore able to withdraw 
 money from your account, you will be liable for the amount of any withdrawals 
 if you have acted fraudulently or with gross negligence.
 
Retention 
 and Set-Off
 
32. Provided 
 we give notice in writing, we have the right to retain and set-off all

 may be. Interest or bonuses will not be paid on any money used in this
