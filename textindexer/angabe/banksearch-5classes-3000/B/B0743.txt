Moving
There are lots of things that you'll need to consider before you move to your new home.
 
How much will it cost me to move?
Whether you're buying or selling you may need to pay legal, survey and removal charges. To find how much your move will cost you, see our moving costs calculator.

Removals
Most professional removal firms are members of the British Association of Removers so you will be protected by the Association's code of practice.
 
Charges can vary considerably. Ask a few firms to come to your home, assess what will be involved in the move and give you a quote - in writing.
 
Arrange your move as far in advance as possible to ensure you can move when you want to and if you do use a professional removal firm, ask them for packing boxes before you move.
 
Things to remember for your move
 
 
 
Arrange to take over the phone at your new home. Contact the line operator - you may be able to keep the line switched on and avoid reconnection charges. 
 
Redirect your post. For a small charge, the Royal Mail will redirect your post to your new address. 
 
Settle paper and milk bills. 
 
Run down your freezer so you can defrost it or, if you don't want to defrost it, turn it up a couple of days before you move to freeze the contents as deeply as possible. 
 
Read the meters at your old and new home. 
 
Don't pack everything! Keep a few essentials handy - mugs, kettle, tea, washing up bowl, vacuum cleaner, bin bags and light bulbs. 
Now check that you have let everyone know your new address!
