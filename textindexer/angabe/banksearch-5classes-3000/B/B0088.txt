 Rates
 
All 
 interest rates are variable (this does not apply to fixed rate products), 
 and current as at 1st December 2001. 
 
 
 The gross rate is the contractual rate of interest payable not taking 
 account of the deduction of income tax at the rate specified by 
 law (the "specified rate") 
 
 
 The annual equivalent rate (AER) is a notional rate which illustrates 
 the contractual interest rate (excluding any bonus payable) as if 
 paid and compounded on an annual basis.
