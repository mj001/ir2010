Fixed Rate Mortgage - 6.50% Fixed Rate Until 15 May 2007
After the fixed rate period the rate will revert to the Society's normal variable base 
rate (currently 5.69%).
A booking fee of £295 is required before proceeding with the application. One 
free building society valuation fee per booking.
Where the loan is in excess of 75% of the purchase price or valuation, the Society 
will charge a one-off high lending fee, equivalent to 7% of the sum lent in excess 
of 75%. This will be deducted from the advance at completion.
If the loan is redeemed or capital repayments in excess of £1,000 per calendar year 
are made (other than capital repayments due under the mortgage) within the first 5 
years, a charge will be made based on 3.5% of the amount repaid in years 1 and 2, 
and 3% in years 3, 4 and 5.
Your home will be used as security and must be adequately insured.
Mortgages available in England, Wales and mainland Scotland, to those aged 18 
and over. Subject to status and valuation. The Society reserves the right to 
withdraw this plan at any time.
Teachers Building Society is a member of the Building Societies Association and 
subscribes to The Banking Code and The Mortgage Code.
*Typical Example 1: Based on the fixed interest rate of 6.50% (APR 6.4%) and 
the Society's current variable base rate, a property with a value of £75,000 with a 
repayment mortgage of £50,000, completing 15 May 2002, will require 60 fixed 
monthly payments £341.59 and 240 at £316.41. The total amount payable over 25 
years (300 payments) is £96,931.55 which includes an estimated amount of 
£117.50 for legal costs and £25 funds release fee.
Typical Example 2: Based on the fixed interest rate of 6.50% (APR 6.4%) and 
the Society's current variable base rate, a property with a value of £60,000 with a 
repayment mortgage of £50,000, completing 15 May 2002, will require 60 fixed 
monthly payments £341.59 and 240 at £316.41. The total amount payable over 25 
years (300 payments) is £67,281.55 which includes an estimated amount of 
£117.50 for legal costs, £25 funds release fee and £350 high lending fee.
These examples are based on known information, taking into account the fixed rate 
period, the booking fee and the free valuation fee: no account has been taken of 
any variation to the interest rate, nor of premiums on any policy(ies) which may be 
taken out in conjunction with the loan. Written quotations available on request.
Information correct as at 18 March 2002.
