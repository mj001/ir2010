YOUR HOME IS AT RISK IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON A MORTGAGE OR OTHER LOAN SECURED ON IT.
Mortgages are available to persons aged 18 or over, secured on freehold or leasehold properties in Wales and England and are subject to status. Security will be required. All lending will be subject to appraisal of the financial standing of the applicants. Written quotations are available from this office on request.
Principality Building Society is regulated by the Financial Services Authority. We arrange life assurance, pensions and investments only with the Norwich Union Marketing Group, members of which are regulated by the Financial Services Authority.
The examples shown assume no variation in the Society's standard rate of interest or in the annual buildings and contents insurance premiums. The APRs quoted are for mortgages on an interest only basis, for which an appropriate pension plan, endowment policy or other suitable means of repaying the capital sum at the end of the term should be arranged.
TYPICAL EXAMPLE Switch & Save Remortgage
For borrowers purchasing a house for £50,000 and applying for an interest only mortgage of £34,000 over 25 years to be secured on the property and opting for the discount. After applying the discount, the initial rate of interest (variable) until 29th February 2004 is 3.70% APR 5.3%. The interest rate (variable) from 1st March 2004 until 31st August 2007 is 4.70% APR 5.3%. The interest rate will revert to our standard variable rate on 1st September 2007. The total amount payable would be £83,682.79 (including the capital sum which would need to be repaid together with the estimated fees and charges of £55.10). Assuming completion of the loan on 1st July 2002 there would be 20 monthly payments of £104.83, followed by 42 payments of £133.17 followed by 238 payments of £157.25. The APR is variable. If the loan is repaid in full before the 31st August 2007, an early repayment charge of £1,020 would be payable. 
Standard Variable Rate
For borrowers purchasing a house for £50,000 and applying for an interest only mortgage of £34,000 over 25 years to be secured on the property. The current rate (variable) is 5.55% APR 5.8%. The total amount payable would be £86,128.78 (including the capital sum which would need to be repaid, together with Maxicover buildings and contents insurance costs, as well as estimated fees and charges of £391.35). Assuming completion of the loan on 1st July 2002 there would be 300 monthly payments of £157.25. The APR is variable.
