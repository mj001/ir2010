i AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if interest was paid and compounded each year. 
 
 
 
ii Net interest is paid or credited after deduction of income tax at the lower rate of 20%. 
 
 
 
iii Gross interest is the rate payable before the deduction of income tax and can only be paid or credited subject to the required certification. Interest cannot be paid gross to individuals not ordinarily resident in the UK for tax purposes. Individuals whose income falls within the 10% starting rate tax band, who are due to pay less tax than the amount deducted from their interest can claim a repayment of tax from the Inland Revenue. Individuals whose income falls within the basic rate band will have no more tax to pay on their interest. Individuals who are higher rate taxpayers will have to pay the extra tax due on their interest (the difference between tax deducted at 20% and the higher rate of 40%)
 
 
 
iv Interest is paid tax-free which means it is exempt from income tax. 
 
 
 
We may change the rates on an account at any time (other than fixed-rate accounts during the period of the fixed rate). If you have one of the accounts shown and we change the rate, we will tell you using at least one of the ways set out in your account's conditions.
 
 
 
Rate changes to a C&G account or to other generally available accounts can affect an account's relative competitiveness and we do not promise that our rates will be better than those available elsewhere. If your balance falls below the minimum shown in the tables, please refer to the conditions of that account or ask for details.
