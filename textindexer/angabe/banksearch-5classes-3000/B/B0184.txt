UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, INTEREST RATES PAYABLE ARE VARIABLE
 
Monthly rates are shown in brackets. 
 
Interest will be paid or credited after deduction of income tax at the lower rate of
 20% or, subject to the required certification, gross (please request form R85).
 Individuals who are non-taxpayers and who have not registered to receive their interest
 without tax deducted, can claim a repayment of tax from the Inland Revenue. Individuals
 with taxable income in the starting band of 10% who are due to pay less tax than the
 amount deducted from their interest can also claim such a repayment. Individuals whose
 taxable income falls within the basic rate band of 22% will have no more tax to pay on
 their interest, as the tax deducted from it at 20% will satisfy the tax due. Individuals
 who are higher rate taxpayers will have to pay the extra tax due on their interest (the
 difference between the tax deducted at 20% and the higher rate of 40%). Interest will be
 paid annually unless monthly income is specified.
 
Gross &#150; The interest rate you are paid before tax.
 
Net* &#150; The interest rate you are paid after the deduction of tax.
 
AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be
 if interest was paid and added each year. If the account pays interest each month, the AER
 assumes that the interest is added to the balance at the end of each month. This
 calculation allows you to make an easier comparison of the returns offered by different
 accounts.
