Interest Rates
 
 
 
IMPORTANT NOTES
 
 
 Interest rates and 
 account terms are variable unless special conditions, described in the 
 Terms and Conditions of those accounts, say otherwise.
 
AER (Annual Equivalent 
 Rate)
 
 AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate. It illustrates what the gross interest 
 would be if interest was paid and added to the account each year. All 
 advertisements for savings products will contain an AER so you can compare 
 more easily what return you can expect from your savings over time.
 
 The gross rate is the contractual rate of interest payable before the 
 deduction of income tax specified by law.
 
Income tax 
 
 Interest will be paid net (this means after we have deducted income tax, 
 currently 20%) unless you have completed an appropriate form to comply 
 with Inland Revenue regulations. The net rates shown in this leaflet are 
 examples only and have been rounded. They assume income tax of 20% has 
 been deducted.
 
If you are a non-taxpayer 
 or, if your total taxable income is only just more than the starting point 
 for paying tax, you may be able to claim a repayment of the tax deducted 
 from the Inland Revenue.
 
If you pay income 
 tax at the basic rate, you will have no more tax to pay on your interest. 
 If you are a higher rate taxpayer you will have to pay additional tax 
 on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the 
 higher rate due.
 
The tax position affecting 
 our accounts is subject to changes in the law.
