Step 2 - Read the terms and conditions
 
 
 
1 
C&G Guernsey Gold and C&G Guernsey 30 ("the Accounts") are deposit accounts with C&G Channel Islands Limited ("the Company") which is licensed as a deposit taker under the Banking Supervision (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 1994 (as amended). This is not an investment in a UK bank but in a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cheltenham & Gloucester plc. 
2 
The Company may:
	
 
 
 
Require verification of your identity, including the taking of references 
 
Refuse to accept any deposit 
 
Require the account to be closed 
 
Close the account if the balance falls below &#0163;5,000. 
 
 
 
Before we do this we will give you 14 days' notice by writing to your last known address. 
 
3 
These conditions may be varied at any time if:
	
 
 
 
There are new laws, or there are amendments to existing laws, which require or permit change, or there is a court case which requires or permits change 
 
We reasonably believe that business needs justify the change, or new services become available which we reasonably believe you will benefit from 
 
There are any other circumstances in which we reasonably believe change is appropriate. 
 
 
 
Any change will be effective only after notice has been given.
 
4 
No deposit or withdrawal request is valid until it is received at the offices of the Company. 
5 
The minimum initial investment is &#0163;5,000. The minimum withdrawal and minimum additional deposit is &#0163;1,000, or major currency equivalent. The maximum holding with the Company is &#0163;5 million. 
6 
Transactions on Guernsey Gold can be made at any time and without penalty. C&G Guernsey 30 requires 30 days' notice for penalty-free withdrawals. Withdrawals which are made without giving notice are subject to a deduction equivalent to 30 days' interest on the amount withdrawn. The deduction will be calculated using the interest rate applicable at the time of withdrawal. 
7 
Interest is paid without any deduction for tax. 
8 
The rate of interest may be changed by us at any time and with immediate effect. We will notify you of rate changes on or before the effective date either by personal notice to you in writing or by advertisement in at least one UK national newspaper. Current rates are available from branches of Cheltenham & Gloucester plc or by calling the rateline. 
9 
Interest is calculated on a daily basis from the date funds are cleared ("the value date"). Interest will then accrue up to but excluding the day of withdrawal. 
10 
If interest is paid monthly to a nominated UK clearing bank the payment will be made via BACS (Bank Automated Clearing System) on the first working day of each month. 
11 
Cheque deposits must be made payable to C&G Channel Islands Limited or to the account holder(s). Cheques made payable to a third party are not acceptable. Foreign currency cheques will be sent for collection but may take several weeks to clear depending on the respective local conditions. No interest will be earned before the cheque has cleared. Foreign currency cheques will be converted to sterling upon receipt of cleared funds by our bankers (net of any charges that may be payable) in accordance with condition 13 below. Where deposits which are sent electronically cannot be applied to an individual account within seven days, funds will be returned to the initiating bank, less appropriate charges. 
12 
Withdrawals may be made only by way of cheque or electronic transfer and against funds which are cleared. There are no facilities for cash withdrawals. Cheques made payable to a third party will be sent only to the account holder's registered address. Payments by electronic transfer may be made to any bank providing the Company has received original written instructions. Where withdrawal instructions are given to us by fax or telephone, payments will be made only to the bank account nominated in the completed mandate on the application form. 
13 
Currency exchanges will be carried out in accordance with standard banking practice in Guernsey. This will normally mean that a currency exchange deal will be agreed on the day the Company receives valid instructions or, if later, upon receipt of cleared deposit funds, for two banking days' forward settlement. The Company reserves the right to vary the settlement period at its discretion. The exchange rates available to the investor will be based on the rate available to the Company at the time the deal is agreed, having regard to the amount involved and on the basis that such foreign currency is available to the Company. 
14 
You may have to pay for transactions and services. These charges may be varied by us. Full details of current charges are set out in the accompanying insert. 
15 
Notices in respect of the account may be served on the Company only at its registered office in Guernsey. 
16 
Any letter, notice or other document posted to the account holder at the last notified address will be deemed to have been duly served 72 hours after it has been posted. 
17 
The Company is entitled (except as may be required by statute or a court of law) to treat the holder of any account as the absolute owner. The Company will not therefore be bound to recognise, nor be responsible for refusing or failing to recognise, a trust or charge in favour of any other person (this will include any equitable or partial interest of, or other claim by, such a person) even where the Company has been given notice. 
18 
In order to maintain our service standards, we may record or monitor telephone calls. 
19 
These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the Island of Guernsey. 
 
Please note:
In line with general banking practice, when the Company transfers funds overseas by electronic transfer, it is unable to guarantee receipt of the funds by the beneficiary within a specific time frame. While every effort is made to ensure that funds are delivered within four banking days of the value date of the transfer, delivery of the funds may be delayed as a result of overseas banking systems, or of complications in the routing of payments. In normal circumstances, it will not be possible to cancel a payment instruction once the funds have been transmitted overseas but at its discretion the Company will endeavour to request a refund of the funds. If this is successful, the customer's account will be credited net of incidental expenses and with the value date on which the Company received the funds.
