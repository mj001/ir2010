Step 1 - Prove who you are
Before we can open an account for you, we'll ask you for some identification.
 
Already a C&G customer?
You'll need to provide us with:
 
 
 
 
Completed application form 
 
Initial investment 
 
Account number of an existing C&G investment or mortgage account 
 
If opening at a C&G branch, please bring a recent document bearing your signature 
New C&G customer?
You'll need to provide us with:
 
 
 
 
Completed application form 
 
Initial investment 
 
Identification
	 If you open your account at a C&G branch, we need one Name ID and one Address ID from the list below If you open your account by post, you'll need to provide two original items from the Address ID list below 
 
All items must be from a different source or provider. We will retain (or keep) a copy of the
	evidence you provide for our records. 
Name ID
 
 
 
Current UK photo-card driving licence, or current full old style driving licence (if not used for evidence of address) 
 
Current signed full passport 
 
Current Benefit payment book or original notification letter from Benefits Agency confirming the right to benefits
	for the current period (if not used for evidence of address) 
 
Most recent Inland Revenue Tax Notification 
 
Building Industry Sub-Contractor's Certificate or Registration Card, issued by the Inland Revenue 
 
Current Firearms Certificate 
Address ID
 
 
 
Utility bill - gas, electricity, water, land-line telephone or certificate from supplier of utilities
	confirming arrangements to pay for services on pre-payment terms (covering current period) 
 
Local authority (council) tax bill, valid for current year 
 
Current UK photo-card driving licence, or current full old style driving licence (if not used for evidence of name and only if opening at a branch) 
 
Bank, building society or credit card statement (excluding statements downloaded from the Internet) or passbook containing current address 
 
Most recent original mortgage statement from a recognised lender 
 
Current local council rent card or tenancy agreement 
 
Benefit payment book or notification letter from the Benefits Agency confirming the right to benefits for current period (if not used for evidence of name) 
Documents provided should be original and current. We will return these to you as soon as possible.
 
Opening an account for someone under 16?
In addition to the identification requirements for you as the operator of the account, we will also need to see the child's birth certificate or passport (the original, not a copy). The application form and birth certificate or passport must be taken to a branch - please do not post them to us.
 
Not normally resident in the UK?
Before we can open an account for you, we'll need to see either your full passport or national identity card. In addition, we'll also need to see one other item to confirm your address, such as a driving licence.
 
If you are opening your account at a branch, the items you supply must be originals. If you are opening by post, however, the items must be copies that have been certified as true copies by an attorney, a notary or embassy consular authority.
	If a certified copy of a passport or national identiy card is provided, the certifier must declare whether the photograph is a 'good likeness' of the applicant.
	
 
As an alternative to the above items you can give us the name and address of a bank in your normal country of residence that will be able to provide a reference for you. However, we will be unable to open your account until we have received a satisfactory reference.
 
Please note that we might also make additional checks.
