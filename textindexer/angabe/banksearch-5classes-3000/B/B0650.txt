 THE MILLERS ACCOUNT
 
 The Millers Account has been developed as a partnership between Rotherham United Football Club and Barnsley Building Society. It is an affinity account for supporters who benefit with an attractive savings account, which also benefits the Club’s finances at the same time, as the Society guarantees to pay an annual bonus.
 
 Account investors have the security of their investments being held in a savings plan with a mutual building society, whilst having the ability to support the Club long term, through the annual bonus payment, which equates to a percentage of the daily balances held under the Millers Account name. This payment is made by the Society.
 
 Opening a Millers Account means you’re supporting your finances with one of the most attractive instant access accounts available, as well as putting your money where your mouth is and showing your full support by assisting your Club financially. And the more you save, the better it gets!

Registration forms are available from any of the Society’s Branches or Agencies, or direct from the Inland Revenue. If you have Adobe Acrobat Reader click here to download the R85 form.
 
 You can also claim a repayment of tax, if your taxable income falls within the starting rate band and you are eligible to pay less tax than the amount deducted from your interest. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate due.
 
 The Society is required to supply the Inland Revenue with particulars of all interest paid or credited to investors each year.
