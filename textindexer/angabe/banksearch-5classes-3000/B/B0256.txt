Welcome to the Manchester Building Society. In these days
 of demutualisation, it's refreshing to know that there are still
 some building societies that have remained true to their founding principles. 
At the Manchester, we have been providing sound financial products since
 1922. We are committed to mutuality because we believe it enables 
 us to offer not only higher levels of service than many banks, but
 also a comprehensive range of attractive investment and mortgage 
 products.
We operate a streamlined organisation, based in the heart of 
 Manchester with a national network of agencies. Because of this we 
 are able to keep our costs to a minimum and pass on the benefits
The regular appearance of our products in the Best Buy tables
 of the national press is testimony to our efforts.
Manchester Building Society is a member of the Financial Services
 Ombudsman Scheme and subscribes to the Banking Code and the
 Mortgage Code. Copies are available on request. We also participate
 in the Ombudsman Scheme and details are available on request.
