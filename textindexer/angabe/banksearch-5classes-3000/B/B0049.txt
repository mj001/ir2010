Mini Cash ISA
- Income Tax Free
- No Charges
- Minimum Subsequent Deposit After Account Opened
- Withdrawals Available Immediately
- Competitive Interest Rate
ISA's are flexible and can be tailor made to suit your finances. You can choose between investing an annual lump sum, making monthly contributions or making contributions when you can afford them.
With ISA's there is a minimum initial deposit of £500 and subsequent deposits can be from £10 upwards, subject to Inland Revenue annual subscription limits.
Interest on your ISA is tax free and will always be at a highly competitive rate. Interest is added on an annual basis on the 5th April each year and full details of current rates can be obtained on a separate sheet from the Society.
How much to save in your ISA is up to you, subject to Inland Revenue limits. You can save a regular amount each week or month, put lump sums in when they become available or a combination of both. Whichever way you decide to save, you will be provided with a passbook showing an up to the minute record of your savings.
You can also transfer savings from any of your other accounts within the society or from any other bank or building society into your ISA, subject to the annual savings limit.
Whilst interest will be paid without any tax deduction, withdrawals can be made at any time. You can make one penalty free withdrawal per financial year. However, any subsequent withdrawal will be subject to 60 days notice or immediately with a loss of 60 days interest on the amount withdrawn.
