 not accept new accounts from new customers who live outside
 our branch operating area. Some restrictions may also apply
 to new accounts available to existing customers who live outside
 our branch operating area. Existing customers should telephone

New
 Investors
 The
 Society requires new investors to agree to assign, for an
 indefinite period any possible future windfall rights, in
 the unlikely event of conversion to a bank or a takeover,
 to a charitable foundation. 
 
 Products are only available to customers resident in England,
 Wales & Scotland.
