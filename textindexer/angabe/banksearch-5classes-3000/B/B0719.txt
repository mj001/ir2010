Money 
 Back Mortgage 
 
 
 
 If 
 you would like a lump sum at the start of your 
 mortgage, to spend as you wish, then a money 
 back mortgage may be right for you. Interest 
 on a money back mortgage is charged at the Society's 
 standard variable rate but you will receive 
 a lump sum on completion to spend as you wish. 
 The money back you receive is equivalent to 
 a percentage of the mortgage advance.
 
If 
 you borrow up to 75% of the purchase price or 
 valuation of the property, whichever is the 
 lower, you will get a sum equivalent to 5% of 
 the mortgage loan. If you borrow more than 75% 
 of the purchase price or valuation of the property, 
 whichever is the lower, you will get a sum equivalent 
 to 4% of the mortgage loan.
