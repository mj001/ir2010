	Concessionary Discount Scheme+
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	Our Mortgage Discount Scheme is designed to reward long standing borrowers. Following your initial 2-year fixed rate period it offers a 0.3% discount for 2 years off the variable rate (currently 5.70%) applicable to your product at that time. Following this period, the discount is increased to 0.5% off the variable rate applicable to your product at that time. So you can receive long-term benefits and value for the term of your mortgage.

	Legal fees package
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	Whether you are looking to re-mortgage or purchase a property we have a great fixed fee legal package. See our Skipton Home Conveyancing Service leaflet and ask your Mortgage Adviser for details now.
	 
	
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Free HPLF
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	If you wish to borrow more than 75% of the valuation or purchase price (whichever is the lower), the Society will charge you a High Percentage Loan Fee (HPLF). This fee will be used to protect the Society in the event that you default on your mortgage.++
	
	We will charge this fee as a one off premium which will be added to your mortgage account. You can, if you choose, pay this up front so that it does not accrue interest as part of the loan.
	
	However, for loans between 75% and 90% of the valuation or purchase price, we will credit your mortgage account with an amount equivalent to the HPLF on completion.
	 
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	How much can I borrow?
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	Provided you have been in permanent employment for at least three months, we’ll lend up to 3.5 times your annual salary. If you’re applying in joint names, the whole of your partner’s salary can be added too. Or you can borrow 2.75 times your combined incomes. The maximum advance we’ll grant with this scheme is 90 of the valuation or purchase price of the property, whichever is the lower.

	Skipton Insurance
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	If you opt for our 2-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage you could choose whichever of these three excellent insurance policies best suits your requirements.
	 
	
	
	
	
	Option 1
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton House and Contents is the ideal policy if you require comprehensive cover for your home and its contents. What’s more, your personal possessions are covered automatically and the contents of your home are covered against accidental damage too. Make sure you ask for details of how you can receive 6 months Skipton Assured cover absolutely FREE when you take out this policy. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 2
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton Homeplan provides cover for your home and contents with a fixed level of contents cover of £30,000 - ideal if you require a limited level of cover. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 3
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton Assured provides security and peace of mind should you be unable to work through accident, sickness or unemployment. You really should think about taking out this essential payment protection insurance in addition to one of the household insurances. 
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Mortgage Advice

So when you’re ready to talk over your application, if you do not have your own Financial Adviser, just call into your local Skipton branch. Alternatively you can call Customer Service on 01756 705035.**

	Further Information
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	
	
- A fee of £250 is required. This can be added to the mortgage on completion, and it will incur interest as part of the loan, or you can pay it up front.
	
- Monthly payments must be made in advance by Direct Debit on the 1st of each month. The interest rates quoted include a 0.25% Direct Debit discount. If the Direct Debit is cancelled, this discount is removed.
	
- You can make a capital repayment of up to 10% of the original loan each year without charge within 3 years from completion.
	
- Any capital repayment greater than 10% of the original loan made in any one year within 3 years of completion will be subject to a charge of 1% of the capital repaid.
	
- If the mortgage is repaid in full within 3 years from completion an early redemption fee of 1% of the mortgage balance will be payable.
	
- If the mortgage is repaid in full after 3 years from completion interest up to the end of the month of redemption will be payable.
	
- If you move house within 2 years of completion, the mortgage product is portable and can be applied to the new property. (Please note: Any concessionary Mortgage Scheme Discount is not portable).
	
- If you exercise portability and the mortgage required for the new property is lower than the balance on the existing mortgage, a capital repayment fee will be payable on the difference between the loans as detailed above.

	NB The valuer’s report is for mortgage purposes only and does not guarantee that the property is free from defects. If you are purchasing a property and you require a Home Buyers Report and a Buildings Survey, please ask an adviser for details.
	
	* The only fluctuation will be limited to any changes in insurance premiums.
	
	+ It is intended that the Scheme will continue in force for the remainder of the term of the mortgage although the Board of Directors of the Society do have the right in their discretion to vary the terms of the Concessionary Scheme or to withdraw or to vary the amount of the scheme discount at any time. If they do so they will give you reasonable advance notice. The present view of the Board is that they would only be likely to do so as a result of exceptional circumstances arising from major changes in market conditions or general building society, banking or other lending practice.
	
	++ High Percentage Loan Fees (HPLF) are used to provide extra security to protect the Society if you default on your mortgage and your property is taken into possession and is sold for less than you owe. This will protect the Society but it does not protect you. You will remain liable to pay all sums owing, including arrears, interest and our legal fees. If a claim is paid to the Society under a third party insurance, paid for out of the HPLF, the insurers will normally have the right to recover this amount from you.
	
	
	TYPICAL EXAMPLE - Flexible 2-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage at 5.19% (APR 5.4%)
	
	The APR of 5.4% assumes that the fixed rate of 5.19% continues for 24 months and then a rate of 5.40% for 24 months, followed by a rate of 5.20% (current variable rate calculated with Mortgage Scheme	Discount) continues throughout the remaining term of the mortgage. The APR has been calculated on the basis of a £50,000 interest only loan (purchase price £69,000) over a 25 year term, and includes a £250 completion fee, £105 legal fees, £160 valuation fee and £45 sealing fee.
	
	The rate of 5.19% (APR 5.4%) requires 24 monthly interest payments of £217 followed by 24 monthly interest payments of £225 followed by 252 monthly interest payments of £217. Total amount payable £115,852.00.
	
	The APR is variable. Subject to status and valuation. Minimum age 18 years. The Society requires a first mortgage on the property. If two or more monthly payments are outstanding at any time, the rate charged will increase to the Society’s variable rate (excluding Direct Debit discount). Written quotations available on request. Skipton Assured cover is provided by London & Edinburgh. Skipton Homeplan and Skipton House and Contents are provided by CGU International Insurance PLC, a member of the CGNU PLC group of companies.
	
	Security will be required for any loan.
