	MORTGAGE REPAYMENT 
	
	Where all or part of your mortgage account is operated on an INTEREST ONLY basis you must ensure that you have adequate repayment 
	methods in place as the amount borrowed on an interest only basis will still be owed at the end of the term.
	
	If you propose to use the proceeds of a policy such as an endowment, we strongly advise that you ensure your premiums are up to 
	date and the amount of cover is sufficient to repay the mortgage. You should also ensure the proceeds are available at the end of the mortgage 
	term.
	
	Your monthly payments to the Society DO NOT include premiums for these policies which MUST BE PAID DIRECT to the Company which issued the policy.
	
	If you have an endowment policy, the Association of British Insurers and its members have agreed a Code of Practice to ensure formal reviews of endowment mortgage policies are carried out regularly. Under the ABI Code, Insurers will tell you if a shortfall is likely to arise where the life policy was bought with the intention of paying off all or part of the mortgage.
	
	If you established a PEP as the means of repaying your mortgage, you should be aware that PEPS were replaced by ISAs in April 1999. 
	If it is your intention to continue with this repayment approach, you should contact your PEP Provider or Financial Adviser to
	ensure that your PEP payments are now being directed to an ISA.
	
	If you currently have a GRE Scheme 'C' Endowment policy (see Insurance Renewal/Schedule), the premiums FOR THIS POLICY ONLY are included 
	in your monthly payment to the Society.
	
	Where you have a mortgage and/or repayment vehicle which will continue beyond your retirement date, it is important that you ensure that you will be able to continue to meet your regular payments.

	NOTES TO ACCOMPANY YOUR 2001 ANNUAL MORTGAGE STATEMENT
	
	Please read the following important notes concerning your Mortgage Statement. These should answer any questions you have. If you need any further help please contact our Statement Hotline on 01756 705 035.
	
	
- PAYMENTS
	
Payments by standing order or giro credit take several days to reach us. Consequently there may be a slight difference between the date on your bank statement and that shown on your Annual Statement, particularly over bank holiday periods. 
	
The Society may, from time to time, implement a mortgage rate change after payment has been requested from your bank. In the event of an interest rate increase, this will result in an amount of interest being charged to the account which is higher than that collected, and so increase the balance outstanding on your account. The converse applies in the event of a mortgage interest rate decrease. 
	
The Payments column should agree with your own records. If there is any discrepancy, please forward the Statement and any supporting documentation to Audit Services, 
P O Box 7, Skipton, North Yorkshire BD23 1DN.
	
	
- PERSONAL DETAILS
	
	If any of the details relating to your name, address and postcode are incorrect, please advise General Administration by writing to Skipton Building Society, Principal Office, The Bailey, Skipton, North Yorkshire, BD23 1DN.
	
	
- INTEREST
	
	The interest charge shown on your statement is the gross interest charged for the year to 31 December 2001.
	
	
- ARREARS AND FINES
	
	It is essential that regular monthly payments are maintained. If for any reason you are unable to do so, you must IMMEDIATELY contact Mortgage Payments on (01756) 705008 as we may be able to help.
	
	Where fines have been debited to your account on 31 January 2001, these represent the amount charged for the year ended 31 December 2000. Any fines incurred during 2001 as shown on your Statement, will be debited to your account on 31 January 2002 and will be interest bearing from 1 February 2002 unless paid directly to the Society before this date.
	
	
- MORTGAGE PAYMENT TYPE
	
	Your chosen method of payment is confirmed on the front of your Annual Statement. The following notes provide further information on the different repayment types.
	
	
	
- 5.1 Capital and Interest
	
	If you are repaying your mortgage on this basis the amount owing should gradually reduce throughout the mortgage term, provided all instalments are paid when due. If you have not already done so, you are advised to consider some form of life cover to enable your mortgage to be repaid in the event of your death prior to the end of the mortgage term. This can be arranged through us if required.
	
	
- 5.2 Interest Only
	
	For accounts operating on this basis, we have agreed specific terms with you to suspend repayments of capital and to accept payments of only interest from you. Therefore, the capital, being the amount borrowed, will not reduce during the mortgage term and it is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient funds to repay your mortgage at the end of the term. If you do not already have life cover equivalent to the amount owing on your mortgage you are advised to consider this to enable your mortgage to be repaid in the event of your death prior to the end of the mortgage term. This can be arranged through us if required.
	
	
- 5.3 Part Capital and Interest and Part Interest Only
	
	If you have chosen this type of mortgage you have opted for a combination of the 'Capital and Interest' and 'Interest Only' methods of repayments described above. It is important that you read Sections 5.1 and 5.2 immediately above this paragraph to understand how your mortgage is to be repaid.
	
	
- 5.4 Important
	
	Customers who have 'Interest Only' or 'Part Capital and Interest and Part Interest Only' mortgages are strongly advised to check that an adequate repayment vehicle is currently in place e.g. an endowment contract or ISA. Monthly payments to the Society do NOT include premiums due for such contracts, which must be paid direct to the life assurance company or ISA plan manager.
	
	
	
- TARIFF OF CHARGES
	
	A copy of our current Tariff of Charges is available on request from your local branch at any time or by writing to Skipton Building Society, Principal Office, The Bailey, Skipton, North Yorkshire, BD23 1DN.
	
	
- NO MAILING REMINDER
	
	From time to time, the Society and other companies in the Skipton Group may bring to your attention additional services and products in writing, 
	by telephone or other electronic media. You can request not to be contacted by writing to Customer Relations at Skipton Building Society, Principal Office, The Bailey, Skipton, North Yorkshire, BD23 1DN.
	
	YOUR ANNUAL STATEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT AND SHOULD BE KEPT IN A SAFE PLACE
	
	Duplicate statements are available on request, whereupon a charge will be made to your account.
	
	
	
	Key:
	
	
	
- Your mortgage account number. Please quote this should you need to contact us about your account.
	
- The date on which your mortgage is due to end.
	
- This section explains if your mortgage is capital and interest repayment or interest only. If your mortgage is interest only you will need to ensure that you have the means to repay the balance at the mortgage end date.
	
- The interest rates which have applied to your account over the past year.
	
- This section shows the type, sum insured and monthly premium for any insurances arranged through the Society for 2002. Insurance premiums are included in your monthly payments. Full cover details on any insurance arranged through the Society can be found in either your Insurance Renewal (issued in December) or your Insurance Schedule (for mortgages completed in December).
	
- If your mortgage is interest only, this section is a reminder regarding the repayment of the capital balance. If you have an endowment policy, please forward the original policy document to Securities, if you have not already done so.
	
- The opening balance appears in the "Advances/Charges" column, as this was the balance of the loan outstanding at the start of the year.
	
- This column illustrates all credits made to your account i.e. your monthly mortgage payments, one-off payments against fees etc.
	
- Insurance premiums were debited to your account on 1st January, and 1/12th of that premium was included in each of your monthly mortgage payments. Interest was not charged on this figure, provided it was paid on the first day of each month.
	
- Any fees or charges debited to your account will appear in this column. If you made a cheque payment to cover these costs you will note that the fee is offset by a corresponding credit in the "Payments" column.
	
- This figure represents the total interest charged over the year.
	
- This figure represents the final balance at the end of the year and becomes the opening balance for year 2002.
	
	
	
	
	
	Interest Notes
	
	We are pleased to confirm that from 1st January 2000 interest was calculated on a daily basis using the current balance.
	
	
	
	
	Capital Repayment Notes
	
	The terms of your mortgage may allow you to make substantial capital repayments over and above your normal, monthly payment. 
	These terms are outlined in the Mortgage Offer. Alternatively, you may call our Customer Service helpline on 01756 705030.
	
	If you have made such a payment during 2001 you will see this shown in the "Payments" column. The payment is reversed and reapplied as an additional payment.
