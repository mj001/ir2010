 The gross rate is the contractual rate of interest payable 
 before the deduction of income tax at the rate specified 
 by law, and the net rate is the rate of interest which 
 would be payable after allowing for the deduction of income 
 tax at the specified rate. Interest will be payable net 
 after the lower rate of income tax has been deducted or, 
 subject to the required certification, gross. Where the 
 tax deducted exceeds an investor's tax liability (if any), 
 a claim may be made to the Inland Revenue for repayment 
 of tax. For individuals whose income falls within the 
 lower or basic rate bands, the tax deducted will match 
 their liability to tax on the interest and they will have 
 no more tax to pay on it. Individuals who are liable at 
 the higher rate of income tax of 40% will have to pay 
 additional tax on the interest to cover the difference 
 between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.
