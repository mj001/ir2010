 At Shepshed Building 
 Society, we want to make your life easier.
 
 We understand that choosing the right mortgage can be difficult. 
 There are so many options, each with different advantages. However, 
 there will always be one mortgage which suits your individual 
 needs. 
 We offer two levels of service under The Mortgage Code:
 Information on the different types of mortgage product we offer so 
 that you can make an informed choice of which to take;
 Information on a single mortgage product only, if we offer one
 mortgage product or if you have already made up your mind.
