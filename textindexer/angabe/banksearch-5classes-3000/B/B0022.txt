	We may consider repayment of this fee over the first 24 months of your mortgage FREE of interest provided your total borrowing including the High Loan to Value Fee does not exceed 95%. The High Loan to Value fee is insurance for our benefit only, intended to cover part of our loss if we have to enforce the mortgage and sell your house for less than the amount outstanding on your loan.
