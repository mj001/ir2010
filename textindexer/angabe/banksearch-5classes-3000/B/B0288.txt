Annual Instalment Review scheme
 
 
 
What is the Annual Instalment Review (AIR) Scheme?
The majority of C&G mortgages taken before January 2000 are in our Annual Instalment Review scheme. We calculate your instalment(s) each year using the balance and interest rate applicable as at 31 December, and they become effective from the following March. The instalment remains the same for 12 months. Although any changes to your interest rate will affect the interest charged to your account, your instalment will not change until 1 March the following year.
	We tell you about your new instalment in January each year with your Annual Statement. This statement also includes other important information about your mortgage and should be kept safely as a record of your account.
	
 
 
 
When are annual statements sent?
Annual statements detailing the interest charged (and insurance if applicable) and payments received from 1 January to 31 December inclusive are sent out during January of the following year. If you require a duplicate, please call our Mortgage Services Helpline on 01452 378098.

Arrears
 
 
 
What happens if I fall behind with my mortgage payments/fall into arrears?
If you miss a payment and get behind with your mortgage (ie you go into arrears), you may have to pay a charge. If, after reasonable requests, you do not pay the outstanding arrears, we may also charge you for any additional administration and legal costs involved. For details of arrears charges please click on the link below.
 
 
 
Can I pay my arrears by Direct Debit?
No. You must arrange to pay this separately.

Bank of England base rate change
 
 
 
What happens when the Bank of England base rate changes?
Following a change to the Bank of England base rate our Standard Variable Mortgage Rate currently 5.95%, may also change. If you are in our Annual Instalment Review scheme any changes will be taken into account at the next annual review. If you are not in the scheme and this interest rate affects your monthly mortgage payments, we will write to let you know of any change.

Direct Debits
 
 
 
What are the benefits of paying by Direct Debit?
 
 
 
 
 
Your mortgage is paid automatically each month direct from your bank. 
 
If your mortgage payment changes, you don't have to do anything as we can automatically collect the new amount from your bank. 
 
You don't have to remember to write a cheque or take cash into a branch. 
 
There is only one form to complete and once your Direct Debit is in place, there's no extra form filling, no trips to the bank. We take care of it all. 
 
 
 
 
I would like to pay by Direct Debit, what do I need to do?
Contact any C&G or Lloyds TSB Branch or call our Mortgage Services Helpline on 01452 378098 for a Direct Debit form.
 
 
 
My bank details have changed, what do I need to do?
Contact us on 01452 378098 and we will send you a new Direct Debit form to complete. Once we have your completed form, we can amend our payment collection details.
 
 
 
I would like to cancel my Direct Debit instruction, do I need to send you written instructions?
No, simply call us on 01452 378098 and we'll cancel it for you
 
 
 
Will you always let me know if my payments are going to change?
Yes, we will always give you notice before we collect the new amount.
 
 
 
Can I pay one C&G loan by Direct Debit and another by bank standing order?
No. With a Direct Debit we will collect all the payments due for all your current C&G loans together as one amount.
 
 
 
Do I need to complete a new Direct Debit instruction if I borrow more?
No. The Direct Debit will automatically collect the increased total payment due at the earliest opportunity.
 
 
 
Can I pay my arrears by Direct Debit?
No. You must arrange to pay this separately.

Charges (including early repayment charges)
 
 
 
Do you make charges for some services?
If you ask for a service that we do not routinely provide for all borrowers, for example, if you ask us to supply photocopies of documents, we may make a charge.
	
	For a list of the charges made for the most frequently requested of these additional services please see our Charges section.
 
 
 
I'm thinking of moving house this year, will I have to pay an Early Repayment Charge?
If you're currently on fixed-rate/capped-rate/discounted or cash-gift terms, we can usually transfer those terms to your new home, which means that if an early repayment charge applies, you may not have to pay it.
	
	If you're not on any special terms, you'll be able to have the best deal on the mortgage of your choice from the range we have available at the time.

First mortgage payment
 
 
 
Why does the letter I have received cover only one loan when I have more than one with you?
We issue a first payment letter when any new loan starts and the figures quoted are for that new loan only. The payment does not cover any other existing loans that you may have with us.
 
 
 
What is initial interest?
Your first payment will include an interest payment for the remaining part of the month in which your loan started, as well as your normal monthly payment. This is explained in the Mortgage Handbook you received with your loan agreement.
 
 
 
I recently sent back the money I intended to borrow. Why have you sent me a letter detailing payments due?
If you have returned the money to us, please be assured that we will not collect any payments. Letters detailing your payments are automatically sent out within five days of issuing the loan - please ignore this letter if you have already retuned the money to us. In most cases, we can cancel the Direct Debit for you.

Home insurance
 
 
 
How do I make a claim under my C&G Home Insurance policy?
Simply call the appropriate number shown below and the claims handlers will take you through the process on the phone.
 
 
 
 
 
If you have a C&G Homecover Plus or Buildings policy, call 0500 555222. You'll need to quote your mortgage account number. 
 
If you have C&G Homecover Plus and are making a claim under the Travel section for a medical emergency or emergency breakdown service, please call 01738 63 55 66, or if you're calling from outside the UK, 0044 1738 63 55 66. 
 
If you have a C&G Home Insurance policy arranged through Lloyds TSB Insurance, please call 0845 300 0141. 
 
 
 
 
Are my son's/daughter's personal possessions covered while they are away at university?
If you have a Homecover Plus policy or C&G Home Insurance arranged with Lloyds TSB Insurance, cover is provided while they are at university, provided that they live at the mortgaged property outside of term time.
	
	Please note that cover is provided during term time only. Loss or damage by theft is excluded unless there is evidence of forced entry/exit into the accommodation. Other exclusions apply and these are detailed in your policy booklet.
 
 
 
I've just realised that I have two home insurance policies running at the same time and I want to cancel the policy I have with you. What should I do?
If you currently have a Homecover Plus or Buildings policy, please send us a copy of your alternative policy schedule, together with a letter from your other insurer confirming the level of cover you have with them, the start date of the policy and confirmation of the number of claims (if any) that you have had with them. If this confirms that you have had two policies in force, and providing there were no claims, we will refund 50% of the insurance premiums you have paid to us while the other policy has also been in force. You can then claim the remaining 50% from the other insurer. If your insurance is arranged through Lloyds TSB Insurance please call them on 0845 3000 141.
 
 
 
I have your buildings insurance policy with accidental damage cover. How can I increase this to include the contents?
 
 
 
 
 
If you have a policy arranged with Lloyds TSB Insurance, please call 0845 300 0141 to discuss the options available to you. 
 
If you have a C&G policy, you will have to upgrade to our Homecover Plus policy. To receive an illustration of cost (quote) for C&G Homecover Plus, simply call our Mortgage Services Helpline on 01452 378098. Before the policy can be upgraded however we will need to carry out some checks on the type of property and whether any part is used for business. 
 
 
 
 
I'm going on holiday with my partner who is not named on the mortgage. Will they be covered under the Travel insurance section of my C&G Homecover Plus Insurance policy?
The travel policy which forms part of the C&G Homecover Plus Policy, covers the mortgage account holder and any members of their family who permanently reside with them, for example a spouse, child, parent etc.
	If you are not married, but have lived together in the mortgaged property for at least six months, we would consider both of you to be covered under the policy.
 
 
 
I work from home two days a week. Does C&G Home Insurance cover my computer?
Home business equipment owned by you, computers, printers etc is covered in the home. Please see your policy booklet for details.

Interest
 
 
 
Is the interest on my C&G mortgage charged annually or daily?
Most C&G mortgages charge interest on an annual basis. The interest is calculated on the amount owing on 31 December of the previous year. However, with a C&G Flexible Mortgage interest is calculated daily on the balance outstanding and added monthly.

Mortgage flexibility
 
 
 
Can I make additional overpayments to my mortgage whenever I want?
Yes. You can make occasional or regular overpayments to your mortgage. There is no limit to the amount you can pay, but please check whether your mortgage carries a charge if you repay all or part of it during the early years (known as an early repayment charge or ERC). Even if you have a loan with an ERC, each calendar year you can repay up to 10% of the start of year balance and we will not make the charge. The precise effect of an overpayment depends on whether your mortgage is on a repayment or interest only basis, when interest is charged and added to the mortgage and when you took out your mortgage with us.
 
 
 
Can I pay less than the amount due some months?
As long as you have made extra payments in the past there is an opportunity to pay less than the instalment due some months. If you would like to take advantage of this option, please talk to us first. It is important to remember that if you pay by Direct Debit, we will not be able to collect the reduced amount by that method.
 
 
 
What happens when I have used up all my overpayments?
You must start paying the full amount due each month. If you do not keep up with the payments on your mortgage, you could fall into arrears, which could ultimately mean that you lose your house.
 
 
 
What happens if I make a lump sum payment?
If you make a capital repayment you will need to contact us to let us know that the payment has been made and that you would like your account adjusted. We will then recalculate your interest and payment immediately. If you have a repayment mortgage and would like us to adjust the term rather than the payment, you would also need to make us aware of this when you send the money to us. 
	
	If you make a capital repayment and you are in the early repayment charge period of a mortgage, you may have to pay a charge. If you are thinking of paying off a large amount, you should bear in mind that each calendar year you can repay up to 10% of the start of year balance without incurring this charge.
	
	For larger amounts, we will apply the charge only to the amount above the 10%. If you are unsure of what charges apply to your mortgage, please call us on 01452 378098 before you make the additional payment.

Mortgage Payment Protection insurance 
 
 
 
How can I claim under my Payment Protection Policy?
 
 
 
 
 
If you have a London & Edinburgh arranged policy and want to make a claim please call 01903 210001. 
 
For general enquiries please call 01903 820333. 
 
If you have a Lloyds TSB arranged policy please call 01444 456545. 
 
 
 
 
I am self-employed. Can I apply for your Payment Protection Insurance? 
Yes you can. The policy will, however, exclude cover if your company goes into voluntary liquidation.
 
 
 
I work on a part time basis. Can I apply for Payment Protection Insurance?
This depends on the number of hours you work each week. Employment is defined in the policy as working for at least 16 hours per week. If, however, you do not qualify and your partner works full time and is named on the mortgage, then he/she could cover themselves for 100% of the loan.
 
 
 
How does the policy define unemployment?
The borrower needs to have a current Job Seeker's Agreement with the Employment
	Service of the Department of Work & Pensions in the UK, the Channel Islands or Isle of Man. The borrower must also be actively seeking employment, not following any gainful occupation and not in receipt of or entitled to receive, a payment in lieu of notice.
 
 
 
I am 65 years old. Can I apply for Payment Protection Insurance?
No. The policy provides cover only for borrowers aged between 18 and 65.

What will happen to my mortgage when my current deal expires?
Your mortgage will switch to C&G's Standard Variable Mortgage Rate. We will write with details of your revised payment(s) and explain the options available to you when your current deal expires.
 
 
 
How can I switch my current C&G mortgage to one of your latest mortgage offers?
Please contact the C&G Branch where you originally took out your mortgage. If your mortgage was arranged through a Lloyds TSB Branch please call 01724 283111. If arranged through C&G Mortgage Direct please call 0800 272131.
