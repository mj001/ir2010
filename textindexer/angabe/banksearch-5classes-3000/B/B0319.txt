	If you are looking for a tracker mortgage then look no further than Skipton's unique Stateside Mortgage!
	
	It is a market rate tracker mortgage which tracks the 3-Month US Dollar Libor Rate (USDL). The 3-Month US Dollar Libor is the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. This is the rate at which banks offer to lend dollars to other banks and is fixed by the British Bankers Association. We will review this rate every 3 months and reset your rate automatically. This means that your rate will be directly linked to the money market.
	
	How does it benefit you? This rate has historically tended to be lower than Sterling 3-Month Libor, which a lot of current mortgages track. However, past performance is not a guide to future performance.
	
	
	
	
	
	Although the Stateside Mortgage tracks a US Dollar rate, all transactions are in Sterling and there is no currency risk. All we ask is that you commit to this mortgage for a minimum term of five years and a redemption charge will be payable if you wish to repay more than 10% of the original mortgage balance each year. However, if you are of the view that US Dollar Libor rates will remain below UK Libor rates over the next five years, as has historically been the case, then this mortgage could be the one for you.
	 
	
	
	 	
	
	
	
	Key Benefits
	
	
- From US Dollar Libor (USDL) plus 1.40% for 5 years.

Concessionary Discount Scheme +
After 5 years your rate will change to the Skipton variable rate, currently 5.70%. But, with our Mortgage Discount Scheme you will automatically receive a 0.5% discount off the variable rate applicable to your mortgage at that time. Ensuring that you receive long term benefits and value for the full term of the mortgage.

property then we have a great fixed fee legal package. 
See our Skipton Home Conveyancing Service for details.
Free HPLF below 90% loan to value
If you wish to borrow more than 75% of the valuation or purchase price (whichever is the lower), the Society will charge you a High Percentage Loan Fee (HPLF). This fee will be used to protect the Society in the event that you default on your mortgage. 
We will charge this fee as a one off premium which will be added to your mortgage account. You can, if you choose, pay this so that it does not accrue interest as part of the loan.
However, for loans between 75% and 90% of the valuation or purchase price, you don't have to pay a penny, as we will credit your mortgage account with an amount equivalent to the HPLF on completion.

	Skipton Insurance
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	If you opt for a Stateside Mortgage with an insurance through the Skipton, you can choose whichever of these three excellent policies best suits your requirements.
	 
	
	
	
	
	Option 1
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton House and Contents is the ideal policy if you require comprehensive cover for your home and its contents. What's more, your personal possessions are covered automatically and the contents of your home are covered against accidental damage too. Make sure you ask for details of how you can receive 6 months Skipton Assured cover absolutely FREE when you take out this policy. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 2
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton Homeplan provides cover for your home and contents with a fixed level of contents cover of £30,000 - ideal if you require a limited level of cover. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 3
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton Assured provides security and peace of mind should you be unable to work through accident, sickness or unemployment. You really should think about taking out this essential payment protection insurance in addition to one of the household insurances.

	Further Information
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	
- An application fee of £100 is required and a further fee of £295 will be debited on completion which will incur interest as part of the loan. You can, if you wish, pay this fee before completion.
	
- To take advantage of USDL plus 1.40% (up to 85% LTV) or plus 1.55% (up to 95% LTV), you need to take out one of the three insurance policies detailed above, which must be maintained for 5 years from completion.
	
- Monthly payments must be made in advance by Direct Debit on the 1st of each month. The interest rates quoted include a 0.25% Direct Debit discount. If the Direct Debit is cancelled, this discount is removed.
	
- Our 3-Month USDL Rate will be recalculated and reset during the first 5 years on the first working day of March, June, September and December of each year. Your new monthly payment will become effective from 1st of the following month. We will write to you to inform you of any change to your mortgage payment.
	
- You can make a capital repayment of up to 10% per annum of the original loan without charge in the first 5 years.
	
- Any capital repayment greater than 10% per annum of the original balance made within 5 years of completion will be subject to a charge of 5% of the capital repaid.
	
- If the mortgage is repaid in full within 5 years of completion, there will be an early redemption charge of 5% of the balance of the mortgage account.
	
- If the mortgage is repaid in full after 5 years of completion, interest to the end of the month of completion will be payable.
	
- If you move house within 5 years of completion, the mortgage product is portable and can be applied to the new property. (Please note: Any Concessionary Mortgage Scheme Discount is not portable).
	
- If you exercise portability and the mortgage required for the new property is lower than the balance on the existing mortgage, a 5% capital repayment fee will be payable on the difference between the loans.
	
- Minimum acceptable property value is £25,000.

	+ It is intended that the Scheme will continue in force for the remainder of the term of the mortgage although the Board of Directors of the Society do have the right in their discretion to vary the terms of the Concessionary Scheme or to withdraw or to vary the amount of the scheme discount at any time. If they do so they will give you reasonable advance notice. The present view of the Board is that they would only be likely to do so as a result of exceptional circumstances arising from major changes in market conditions or general building society, banking or other lending practice.
	
	++ High Percentage Loan Fees (HPLF) are used to provide extra security to protect the Society if you default on your mortgage and your property is taken into possession and is sold for less than you owe. This will protect the Society but it does not protect you. You will remain liable to pay all sums owing, including arrears, interest and our legal fees. If a claim is paid to the Society under a third party insurance, paid for out of the HPLF, the insurers will normally have the right to recover this amount from you.
