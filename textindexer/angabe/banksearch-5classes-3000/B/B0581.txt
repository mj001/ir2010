Buy up to 10...
...or buy just one
With the instability of the stockmarkets many people are looking for alternative ways to fund their future. With its recently enhanced product criteria, Ten to Let could be the ideal solution. And here's why...
- No maximum age limit.
- Up to 10 properties or a maximum portfolio of £2.5m (whichever is the lower).
- HPA (Higher Percentage Advance) fee free.
- Now also available on properties in mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Plus
- Available for purchase or remortgage up to 85% LTV.
- Self-financing basis - rental income required at 130% of monthly repayment.
Then there's our fixed rates...
TMB are pleased to announce their new fixed rate pricings. 5.99% APR 6.1 to 31.03.2005 and the new 5.49% APR 6.0 to 30.09.2003 makes TMB's product range even better. Both rates are available up to 85% LTV self-certification and 95% LTV for full status, which includes a non-flexible Next Move.
And then there's our awards...
We've done it again! Following hard on the heel of our achievements in 2001 for a record year ending with 2 awards, TMB are delighted to announce we continued the trend in picking up more awards this year with the recent Mortgage Introducer awards in London.
And finally...
TMB will be at the Money Marketing IFA Show in Belfast on 20th June so don't be shy, please do come along to stand number 21 at the Hilton Hotel to meet and greet our team.
