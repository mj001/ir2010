Please note past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance, the value of
units can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed. No product charges have been taken into account
except the fund management charge. Since July 1997 pension funds have been unable to recover tax deducted at source on dividends from UK equities.
Please note funds not designated in sterling may rise and fall simply as a result of exchange rate
fluctuations.
