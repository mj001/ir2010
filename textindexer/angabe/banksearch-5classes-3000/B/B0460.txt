	 Direct Guide to Savings, Fees/Charges & Banking Code Details
 	 Although there are 27 branches of the Stroud & Swindon, not everybody finds it convenient to call in whenever they want to withdraw or deposit money. That’s why we now offer a range of accounts which you can operate by post or telephone with our Contact Centre in Stroud on 0800 61 81 61
This explains how to open an account, how accounts operate and our general terms and conditions.
HOW TO OPEN A DIRECT ACCOUNT
Opening an account is easy. First you should read through the range of products on our site to see which DIRECT account best suits your needs. Then download and complete the application form or talk to requesting this information. The minimum amount you need to open an account varies, depending on the type of account. 
PROOF OF IDENTIFICATION
By law we are required to verify the identity of anyone who opens a savings account with us. This helps to protect the Society and its customers from fraud. You will find that the same conditions apply to all banks, building societies and other financial institutions offering similar products.
We always try to make the process as straightforward as possible. 
• If you already have an account with us you can quote your account number on your application as evidence of your identity and address. 
• If you are a new customer you will need to supply us with three separate items of documentation confirming your identity. 
This means that you will need to provide us with :
A) One of the following to provide personal identity 
(photocopied document required)
• Current U.K. Drivers Licence
• Current U.K. Passport
• Benefit or Pension Book
B) Two of the following to provide confirmation of your address 
(original documents required)
• Recent Council Tax Bill
• Recent Mortgage Statement
• Recent Bank Statement
• Recent Utility Bill
NOTES
• RECENT means no more than six months old
• If you are opening a joint account, BOTH account holders will need to supply the required identification documents.
• Please send only photocopies for section ‘A’
• Please send only originals for section ‘B’
• The original documents will be returned to you.
• These lists are not exhaustive and if you require further assistance, please call our Customer Service Helpline on 08457 045 012 for further information
PLEASE NOTE that we are unable to open an account unless valid documentation is provided.
When you open an account you will receive a Welcome Pack that contains everything you need to manage your savings from the comfort of your own home. All the stationery you need is provided so that you can post your requests free of charge, or you can telephone our dedicated support team, whichever you find most convenient. The choice is yours.
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
CHARITABLE ASSIGNMENT
We require all new investors to agree to assign any future windfall benefits to the Charities Aid Foundation. A windfall benefit is a benefit which you, as a shareholding member of the Society, could receive in the unlikely event of any future transfer of our business by way of take-over or conversion to a Bank. Your savings will still be transferred to a new account with the successor organisation, but any additional benefits will count as windfall benefits. The agreement to assign is for a period of 5 years from the account opening date and will not apply in the event of a merger with another Building Society.
The Charities Aid Foundation receives and administers charitable donations which are passed on to other specific charitable organisations. They have agreed to use any money received by them under the assignment scheme to support housing, the
environment, education, security, health and the relief of social exclusion. If you were an existing shareholding member on 21 April 1999 and continuously maintain a shareholding account with us you are not affected by the change. For example, you may open new accounts or transfer monies from one account to another as an exempt customer.
There are other categories of exempt customers. These include all joint account holders and others (e.g. a deceased’s widow or widower) to whom an account already opened on 21 April 1999 is transferred.
This information is only a summary of the Charitable Assignment scheme; the complete terms are set out in our account application form.
MAKING INVESTMENTS AND WITHDRAWALS
You can make additional investments by cheque at any time, or by regular standing order. If you wish to pay by standing order, please ask us for a form.
When you withdraw money from any of our Direct accounts, we automatically transfer it to your UK bank or building society account, via BACS (Bank Automated Clearing System). Please refer to the appropriate product booklet for details.
Each account has rules that apply to withdrawing funds. Some accounts require you to give us notice that you want to withdraw money. For example, a 30 Day notice account requires you to give us 30 days’ notice; you may withdraw funds without notice but doing so means that you lose 30 days’ gross interest on the amount you withdraw.
CHEQUE CLEARANCE
After paying in a cheque, you may not make a withdrawal for eight working days, unless the previous balance in your account is sufficient to cover it. This is because it can take up to this time for us to be certain that a cheque has been ‘cleared’.
We appreciate that it may be frustrating to wait so long to withdraw funds. However, we have a legal duty to protect our customers and the Society from losses caused by paying out funds against a cheque which is subsequently returned.
Please note that the Society’s own cheques are regarded as being ‘cleared’ immediately. This means that when you pay one of our cheques into your investment account, you can withdraw funds at once.
WHEN YOUR SAVINGS EARN INTEREST
Cheques paid into your account start to earn interest on the fourth bank working day after we receive it. For example, if we receive your cheque on a Monday, your money begins earning interest on the Friday.
CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES
From time to time, like all financial institutions, we vary our interest rates. Such changes will be notified by letter or by advertisement in two of the following national newspapers.
• The Guardian
• The Independent
• The Daily Mail
• The Daily Telegraph
You are free to close your account if you are unhappy about the new rates of interest. Please note, however, that closing some types of account early can involve a financial penalty. Interest rate changes can take place to reflect any of the following:
• Current competitive interest rates in the financial markets
• Changes in the way we administer accounts
• Changes in the law or in the way we are regulated
CHANGES TO OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
We do not normally do so, but occasionally terms and conditions may have to be changed. We will tell you personally and always give you at least 30 days’ notice before any change takes effect.
If the change is to your disadvantage, we will tell you personally and ignore any notice period on your account for at least 60 days starting from the date of the notice. You will not have to pay any additional charges or additional interest as a result of a switch or closure during this period.
INCOME TAX
For basic rate taxpayers, we are required by Inland Revenue regulations to deduct income tax at the appropriate rate from any interest paid and to account for this amount to the Inland Revenue. If you pay income tax at a higher rate, you will have to pay additional tax on the interest - to cover the difference between the tax deducted by us and the higher rate due.
If you are a non-taxpayer, we can pay interest gross (i.e. without deduction of tax). All you need to do is complete and return an R85 registration form. Please ask us if you need one. Non-taxpayers who have already had income tax deducted in a previous tax year should complete form R95 (only available from the Inland Revenue). It may enable us to backdate the adjustment to the beginning of the 3 direct guide to saving 4 direct guide to saving current tax year. You may then be able to reclaim tax direct from the Inland Revenue. 
On joint accounts where one saver is a non-taxpayer and the other pays tax, we can pay 50% of the interest gross.
DEATH
We appreciate that this is a distressing time but, if an account holder dies, we should be notified as soon as possible. In the case of a single account holder, his or her personal representatives may close the account (after providing evidence of their authority to do so)
by withdrawing all the money, together with any interest earned. If the account is held jointly, we will close it and automatically transfer the balance into the name of the surviving account holder.
If the sum due to the estate is less than £5,000 we may pay the money to the person entitled without a formal grant of probate or letters of administration.
TRANSFER
We may transfer the savings to another person, but will only do so with your consent. We reserve the right to refuse a transfer.
CONDITIONS
In addition to these conditions, the Special Conditions of your Account are set out in the promotional booklet which forms part of the application form which you have signed. You should retain the booklet for reference.
If any Special Condition is inconsistent with these conditions, the Special Condition is to apply.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE SOCIETY
You will be an investing member and are bound by our Rules. As a member you have a say in the way we conduct our affairs. You have important rights. You are entitled to take part in and vote at our Annual General Meeting (AGM) usually held in April, and any special general meeting. You will automatically receive notice of the AGM and a copy of our Annual Summary Financial Statement. You may request at any time a copy of the Society’s Rules and Memorandum, and a copy of the detailed Annual Report and Accounts for the previous year.
JOINT ACCOUNT HOLDERS
If the account is in joint names you may choose the order in which the names appear in our records. The person whose name appears first in our records will be regarded as our member and you can decide whether one or both persons are required to authorise withdrawals. We do not recognise any trusts or other terms applicable to monies invested with us.
For joint accounts these terms and conditions and any special conditions apply to you together and each of you on your own.
If there is any dispute between you as joint account holders please inform us and we will arrange to place a stop on further transactions which do not have the authority of all signatories. Until that time, any authorised signature will discharge
us from any liability in respect of money paid.
MEMBERSHIP DOCUMENT
When your account is opened we will send you a passbook. Whilst this remains our property, it is your evidence of membership and you must take care of it.
If the passbook is lost you should notify us immediately on 0345 045 012. Please note that we cannot accept responsibility for any withdrawal made by any person producing the passbook and holding him or herself out to be you unless you have notified us that the passbook is missing.
We may open a new account for you when you have given us written details of the circumstances surrounding the loss of the passbook. If we are satisfied we will arrange a transfer of all the savings in your old account to the new account. We
may charge a fee to cover our administrative costs.
SECURITY FOR YOUR SAVINGS
We are a member of the Building Societies Investor Protection Scheme established under the Building Societies Act 1986. Payments under this scheme are limited to ninety per cent of a saver’s total shares and/or deposits, subject to a maximum payment to any one investor of £18,000 (or the sterling equivalent of 20,000 Euro if greater). Most shares and deposits nominated in sterling, other European Economic Area currencies and Euro at our offices are covered. Please ask us for more details.
MINIMUM INVESTMENT
If the amount of money in the account falls below the minimum investment and/or balance set out in the Special Conditions for the Account, we may either pay interest on the money then invested in the account at the standard variable rate of interest which applies to our Classic Gold Account, or we may close the account.
If we decide to close the account as a result of the amount of money in the account falling below the minimum investment and/or balance, we will pay interest up to and including the day before we close the account.
MAXIMUM INVESTMENT
The total amount which you may invest with us must not exceed £500,000.
CLOSING AN ACCOUNT
You may close an account at any time, but please note that closing some accounts early may mean that you incur a financial penalty.
We may give at least one month’s written notice and repay your savings or any part of it. If this happens we will pay interest at the agreed rate up to and including the date of payment. Repayment may be sent by ordinary post to the account holder(s). We can only do this if your account has not been issued for a fixed term.
If monies standing to your credit are unclaimed for the requisite period and, after enquiries we cannot trace you, we may close the account and the savings may be forfeited. If the amount is less than £100 the requisite period is three years.
For sums greater than £100 the period is five years. If this happens, you may ask us to reopen the account and recredit monies.
OTHER DEBTS TO US
If you owe us any money, for example sums which may be due under a mortgage account or guarantee, we have a right to call on any money in an account you have with us. If we do this, no further interest or bonus payment (if applicable) will be credited to the account.
CHANGE OF ADDRESS AND NOTIFICATION
Please keep us informed of any change of address. We are required to advise you of various issues affecting your membership of the Society and we will do this by writing to the last address you have given us. We are entitled to assume that it has reached you within 72 hours of posting to that address.
FEES
There are no charges for normal account transactions. We may charge customers for services we regard as non-standard, such as replacing lost passbooks. If we do make a charge you will be advised at the time the service is requested.
RECORDING AND MONITORING TELEPHONE CALLS
We may record or monitor telephone calls in order to ensure security for our customers and staff and to help maintain service quality.
LAW
The law of England and Wales governs the interpretation and enforcement of the terms of your account.
COOLING OFF PERIOD
If you are not happy about your choice of savings or investment account within 14 days of opening it, we will help you switch accounts or pay back your money with interest. We will ignore any notice period and any additional charges although cheque receipts must be cleared before the monies can be refunded. This will take eight working days. This does not apply to fixed rate accounts.
SOLVING PROBLEMS
Our aim is to provide the highest standard of service to all our customers. However, things do occasionally go wrong. When this happens, we want to put matters right as quickly as possible. The following procedure is designed to deal with any difficulties promptly and efficiently. If you have a complaint, please ring us on 0345 045 012 and we will do all we can to sort it out. If the problem is not resolved to your satisfaction, you should then send full details to the Chief Executive at our Head Office.
If you feel the matter has still not been properly resolved you may write to the Financial Ombudsman Service, who will investigate it impartially. The Ombudsman’s address is: South Quay Plaza, 183 Marsh Wall, London E14 9SR.
Please note that the Ombudsman will only deal with your complaint if our own complaints procedure is complete and you have taken the other steps listed above.
CONFIDENTIALITY
Details of your financial affairs are strictly confidential. Information about you or your account is only disclosed to outside parties if you give your consent, or when the law requires us to do so.
You have the right to see a copy of your personal records held on our files. (Please note that we may make a small charge for this service). We will not make your name or address available to other organisations for marketing purposes without your consent. We use the information you give us to decide which of our products or services may be of interest to you and occasionally may want to give you details, by way of post, telephone call or email, of new services and special offers. You have the opportunity to tell us if you prefer not to receive such information.
