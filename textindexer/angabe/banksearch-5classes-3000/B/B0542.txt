Further Information for all Portman ISA products.
Your tax-free allowance
 
- The Portman Easy Access ISA and 
 the 2 Year Fixed Rate ISA are mini cash ISAs. With either account you can subscribe up to a maximum of £3,000 during the tax year which ends 5 April
 2003. 
 You may only take out one mini cash ISA in any tax year.
 
- If you want to invest more money tax-free, you can also subscribe up to £3,000 in a mini stocks and shares ISA with another provider.
 
- You may also invest an additional £1,000 in a mini life insurance ISA with another provider.
 
- This gives you a total allowance of £7,000 to invest tax-free during the
 2002/2003 tax year.
 
- By subscribing to any of these ISAs, you may not subscribe to a Maxi ISA in the same year.
Who can apply?
You must be at least 16 years old (or 18 years old for a TESSA Only ISA).
You must be resident in the UK or considered ordinarily resident.
Accounts can only be held in a sole name.
Making withdrawals
Subject to the terms of the investment that you have chosen, you are able to 
make a withdrawal from an ISA or TESSA Only ISA at any time without loss of tax 
relief.
Once you have subscribed the maximum amount allowed by the regulations, no further subscriptions are permitted during that tax year, regardless of how much you withdraw. Please note it is not a question of how much you have in your ISA at any one time, but how much you have invested during the relevant tax year.
CAT standards
The Portman ISA products do not conform to the Government CAT
Standards. This is because the rate of interest is not linked to the Bank of England Base Rate 
on the Easy Access ISA and the 2 Year Fixed Rate ISA and because of the
conditions attached to withdrawals on the 2 Year Fixed Rate ISA.
Additional information
The tax-free status of ISAs has been guaranteed by HM Government until 5 April 2009.
Closing your Portman ISA
You may close your Portman Easy Access ISA or 2 Year Fixed Rate ISA or transfer it to another ISA provider at any time, (subject to the terms of the account you have chosen). 
You may close your 2 Year Fixed Rate Tessa Only ISA or transfer to another ISA Manager
before 30 April 2004 subject
to 90 days' loss of interest (to be deducted from the capital if necessary). However 
please note, you will not be able to open another mini cash or maxi ISA with the 
Portman or any other ISA provider during the same tax year.
