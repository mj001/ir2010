 ACCESS TO YOUR INVESTMENT
 
 Should you wish to make a withdrawal from your Falcon 50 years+ account, you may do so in two ways which will not be subject to penalties:
 
 
- Withdrawals which leave the account balance over £50,000 are available penalty free with instant access.
 
- Withdrawals which leave the account balance below £50,000 are also available, but the account holder must give 180 days notice.
 
 Should you wish to make an immediate withdrawal which will leave the account balance below £50,000, you may of course do so, but with the loss of 180 day's interest on the amount withdrawn.
 
 INTEREST PAYMENTS
 
 Annual Interest
 
 Interest is paid annually to the account on the 31st December. This payment can be credited directly to the account or paid to another Society account.
 
 Monthly Interest
 
 Monthly interest is paid on the last working day of every month. This can be credited to another Society account or paid direct to your bank account.
 
 Current interest rates will be supplied to you on request and are on display at all Branch and Agency offices.
 
 INCOME TAX
 
 Interest will be paid after deduction of income tax at the lower rate or, subject to the required certification, gross. Registration forms are available from any of the Society's Branches or Agencies, or direct from the Inland Revenue. If you have Adobe Acrobat Reader click here to download the R85 form. If you are a non-taxpayer you will be able to claim repayment of this tax directly from the Inland Revenue. You can also claim a repayment of tax, if your taxable income falls within the starting rate band and you are eligible to pay less tax than the amount deducted from your interest. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.
 
 The Society is required to supply the Inland Revenue with details of all interest paid or credited to investors each year.

We will ignore any notice periods and additional charges in these cases.
 
*Please note: Cheques paid in within the 14 day period will have to clear before a refund can be given.

The portion of the withdrawal between the existing balance and £50,000, will be penalty free, with the remainder of the withdrawal taking the balance below £50,000, incurring 180 day's loss of interest at the prevailing interest rate.
 
Withdrawals are available with 180 days written notice where interest is paid in full, or payable on demand, with the loss of 180 days interest on the amount withdrawn. For notice withdrawals, a period of 7 day's grace is allowed at the end of the notice period, after which, notice will have to be resubmitted if penalty interest is to be avoided.
 
If the balance of a Falcon 50 years+ annual accounnt falls below £10,000, the account will be closed and the balance transferred to a Falcon Instant Access account, with the loss of 180 days interest on the closing balance.

Additional interest becomes payable when an account balance reaches £25,000, £50,000 and £100,000 respectively. Conversely, when an account balance falls below these levels, the interest rate payable will be reduced accordingly.
 
Penalty interest is debited to the account, calculated on the amount withdrawn at the prevailing interest rates applicable to the tiered levels.

- MONTHLY INCOME OPTION - Interest will be paid on the last working day of each month either to a suitable account with the Society or direct to a bank account. Accounts will receive the first interest payment on the last working day of the same month, unless they are opened within the last 5 working days of a month, in which case the initial interest payment will cover the period from the date the account was opened, to the end of the following month. Thereafter, the amount of each monthly payment will be based on the number of days in the month.
 
If the balance of a Falcon 50 years+ monthly account falls below £10,000, payments will stop, the account will be closed and the balance transferred to a Falcon Instant Access account, with the loss of 180 days interest on the closing balance.
