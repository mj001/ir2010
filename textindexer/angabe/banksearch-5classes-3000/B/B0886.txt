 Strategy
 
The
 Directors believe that there is significant potential for growth in
 the UK non-conforming mortgage market and that there are good
 prospects for Kensington&#146;s continued growth in this market.
 Kensington&#146;s strategy is to continue to focus on its core market
 and to build on its competitive strengths, which include:
 
 
 
 
- 
 
its reputation as a leader and innovator in the non-conforming
 mortgage market;
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
 
 its well-established multi-channel distribution network;
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
 
 the strength and experience of its management team;
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
 
the depth of its underwriting experience working within the
 framework of flexible and disciplined underwriting criteria and
 controls;
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
 
its outsourcing strategy which minimises fixed costs,
 facilitates rapid growth, provides access to the skills of its
 external service providers and enables management to concentrate
 on the issues that are central to the success of the business;
 and
 
 
 
- 
 
its
 good relationships with regulators and participation in
 initiatives to raise industry standards and improve practices.
 
 
 
 
In
 support of the above strategy, Kensington&#146;s management will be
 concentrating on the following initiatives:
 
 
 
 
- 
 
customer
 retention, through cross-selling of additional products such as
 insurance, selling further advances to existing borrowers and
 testing other retention strategies;
 
 
 
- 
 
forming
 relationships with traditional lenders to review their declined
 applications:
 
 
 
- 
 
developing
 additional distribution channels to target other segments of the
 non-conforming market; and
 
 
 
- 
 
reviewing
 the business processes of Kensington (including those activities
 outsourced to third party service providers) to improve
 cost-effectiveness and speed.
 
 
 
 
The
 Directors believe that Kensington is also well positioned to
 benefit from external changes in the mortgage market as a result
 of consolidation and the increased participation of traditional
 lenders seeking commission income through referring non-conforming
 applicants to leading specialist lenders such as Kensington
