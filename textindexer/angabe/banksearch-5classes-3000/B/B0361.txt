	THE PRINCIPALITY - NEW NAME ON THE CHALLENGE CUP
Principality Building Society, Wales' largest independent financial services organisation, is to sponsor the main domestic rugby union competition, the Welsh Challenge Cup for the next three years. The clubs will compete for The Principality Cup.
 
The deal is a major boost to the WRU in that it gives its premier domestic competition a title sponsor whilst, with the support of a leading Welsh company, it is able to make further investments at the very base of the rugby pyramid in Wales at grass roots level.
The Principality's Chief Executive, John Mitchell, was pleased that the Society's objective had been met, "We are particularly delighted that, through our sponsorship of the Principality Cup, we are supporting Welsh rugby at grass roots level. We are very keen to see our funding feed through to local clubs where development of their youth programmes and skill workshops will be the key to success at both club and international level. The Principality's success derives from the strength of its roots in communities throughout Wales in much the same way as Welsh rugby's strength has to derive from a healthy competition at club level."
Chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union, Mr Glanmor Griffiths was delighted to welcome Principality's support, "There are few countries that give rugby such a focus and where better to underline your community commitment than with the country's best supported sport. The Cup competition has been a huge success since its inception in 1971 and it is apt that our leading domestic competition is now sponsored by one of our leading home-grown companies."
Welsh coach Graham Henry commented, "The new sponsorship of the Principality Cup will enable us to plough more money into the development side of the game. We have officers out in the field spreading the rugby gospel. This new sponsorship should prove a major boost to all the work being done in attracting new recruits and improving the grass roots work already being done."
Mr Mitchell continued, "As a building society, the Principality is committed to developing and maintaining close links with the communities in which we operate. The Principality Cup, combined with our existing range of community initiatives, further demonstrates our commitment to achieve this goal."

	ROUND ONE PREVIEW - SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2001
After playing a preliminary round three weeks ago, this season's PRINCIPALITY CUP begins in earnest tomorrow for 144 Welsh rugby clubs.
All roads will lead to the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, May 18 next year when the final of the cup will take place.
Before that, there will be Rounds 2 to 8 and then the semi-final stage, leaving two clubs to battle it out for the trophy. Last season saw Newport defeat Neath in the final, but many surprises take place in this the most fascinating of all Welsh rugby's competitions.
This will be the second year of sponsorship by the PRINCIPALITY. The Principality’s Chief Executive John Mitchell said, " We felt that the experience of our first year’s involvement was a success. We are particularly delighted that, through our sponsorship of the Principality Cup, we continue to support Welsh rugby at grass roots level. We are very keen that our funding feeds through to local clubs where development of their youth programmes and skill workshops is the key to success at both club and international level. The Principality’s success derives from the strength of its roots in communities throughout Wales in much the same way as Welsh rugby’s strength has to derive from a healthy competition at club level.”
Round 1 will see many interesting clashes and many friendships made, as the vast majority of clubs have never met in a cup competition that began in 1972.
"Developing and maintaining close links with the communities in which we operate is a key aim of the Principality Building Society”, continued John Mitchell. "The Principality Cup, combined with our existing range of community initiatives, further demonstrates our commitment to achieve this goal.”
Highlights of the first round are probably the North versus South clashes, particularly featuring Penarth's trip to Bangor with Wrexham going in the opposite direction to Old Penarthians. Abergavenny scored a century points last season in an early round and in this season's preliminary round they were at it again, notching exactly 100 to defeat Alltwen. It will be with some trepidation that West Wales club Laugharne will travel to Bailey Park. Abergavenny coach Keith James knows all about this cup, having played in the 1973 final.
