 	LENDING TERMS
	 
MINIMUM VALUATION - £35,000.
MINIMUM/MAXIMUM LOAN - £25,000/£250,000 (Loans between £250,000 and £750,000 by negotiation).
MAXIMUM LOAN TO VALUE - 80% on purchase and remortgage up to £250,000. If you are Capital Raising the maximum is 80%.
STATUS - 3 x main income, 3 x main + 1 x second income or 2.5 x joint income.
TYPES OF MORTGAGE - Capital and Interest or Interest only. Loans are generally repaid over a maximum period of 25 years (minimum 5 years).
MANDATORIES - Payment by Direct Debit to be debited on or after the 28th of the month.
CLAWBACK OF MONEYBACK -The moneyback will be repayable if the loan is redeemed, a transfer to an alternative product is agreed or capital repayments made (except normal monthly payments on a Capital and Interest mortgage) within the first five years. The amount of moneyback repayable will be calculated as a percentage of the amount of the original loan repaid on the sliding scale percentages detailed below.
- Year One - 5%
- Year Two - 4%
- Year Three - 3%
- Year Four - 2%
- Year Five - 1%
Example: If you have a loan of £100,000 which is fully repaid in year three the moneyback repayable to the Society will be £3,000. In year five the repayment would be £1,000.
EARLY REDEMPTION CHARGE - This product is not subject to early repayment charges although the clawback of moneyback detailed above will apply. Interest is charged up to and including the date of redemption.
ARREARS MANAGEMENT - If the account falls into arrears, the Society may, at its discretion, vary the interest rate applicable to the amount outstanding under the mortgage to its prevailing Variable Mortgage Rate.
*The High Percentage Advance Charge is an insurance, for the sole benefit of the Society, against potential loss in the event of a default in repayment of the mortgage loan. 
	 
 
 
 
 	APR INFORMATION
	 
APR 6.2% variable: rate correct at 1.12.01. A typical example for a 5% Moneyback Mortgage is based on a £37,500 Interest only Mortgage, with a property valuation of £50,000, over 25 years. The monthly payments will be 300 at £187.19. The Total Amount Payable will be £94,099.50 which includes: Valuation Fee of £175.00, Estimated Legal Fees (including VAT) of £117.50, Property Self-Insurance Administration Charge of £25.00, Property Self-Insurance Contingency Insurance Charge of £5.00, Telegraphic Transfer Charge of £30.00, Deeds Access of £40.00, Document Sealing Charge of £50.00, one repayment of £37,500 and accrued interest of £56,157.00 (the amount to be paid, in each case, to ensure that the assumed term of the loan is not extended or the balance of the account does not increase). For the purposes of the calculation it has been assumed that the Society's Variable Mortgage Rate, currently 5.99%, will remain unchanged throughout the term of the loan.
