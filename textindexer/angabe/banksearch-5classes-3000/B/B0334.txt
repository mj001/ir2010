Chelsea Continues to Flourish
 
28th March 2002
 
Chelsea Building Society reviews a successful year at its AGM and looks 
 forward to the future as a successful, independent building society.
 
At the Chelsea Building Society AGM today, Chairman Tim Barry told members 
 that the Society had achieved a very strong performance in 2001.
 
Progressive interest rate cuts - which numbered 7 over the course of 
 the year - helped keep the UK out of recession and supported a buoyant 
 mortgage market. In these conditions, Chelsea outperformed the market 
 with net new lending of £471 million - more than twice 
 the Society's natural market share*.
 
Net new savings at £721 million also exceeded natural market share*, 
 with fixed rate bonds, Mini-Cash ISA and Call Direct products proving 
 especially popular with investors.
 
The year also saw the opening of a new branch in Southampton and the 
 relocation of premises in the City of London and Exeter. The facilities 
 available to members were further enhanced in 2001 by the launch of the 
 Chelsea Interactive Mortgage Service offering a decision within 15 minutes.
 
Tim Barry said: "This year, once again, our members have enjoyed 
 the advantages of doing business with a building society that has strong 
 capital ratios, a high level of efficiency and a total commitment to customer 
 service. This means that we are able to offer more attractive rates on 
 both mortgages and savings products."
 
The members of the Society also re-elected three existing directors and 
 elected a non-executive director, Jean Wood, with overwhelming majorities 
 in excess of 90%. These votes for strongly pro-mutual directors, as well 
 as the results of a MORI members' survey (see Notes for details) confirm 
 that the Chelsea's members value the long-term benefits of mutuality.

 Societies Association.

MORI Survey. In January 2002 the Society commissioned MORI 
	Financial Services to consult a cross-section of saving and borrowing 
	members to ask their opinion on certain issues. They contacted 1,002 
	members by telephone from the 3rd-6th January 2002.
	
 
 
 
- A similar survey was carried out in 2001 and, when compared, the 
 results indicate increased support for the Society's mutual status. 
 In 2001, 68% of borrowers and 60% of savers felt the Society should 
 remain a building society. In 2002 this increased to 74% of borrowers 
 and 74% of savers. (Percentages are of those expressing an opinion.)
 
- The survey indicated that 80% of borrowers and 81% of savers thought 
 that building societies offered better rates than banks. (Percentages 
 are of those expressing an opinion and exclude those who neither agreed 
 nor disagreed.)
 
- 95% of borrowers and 97% of savers were satisfied with the service 
 they receive from Chelsea Building Society. (Percentages are of those 
 expressing an opinion and exclude those who are neither satisfied nor 
 dissatisfied.)
 
 
 
The overwhelming support for the Society's standards of service and mutual 
 positioning has markedly improved since the 2001 survey, which itself 
 gave a clear endorsement to the Society's positioning.
