 THE ACCOUNT
 
 The Falcon 60 account has been developed to offer the best of both worlds. Your account will offer you very attractive rates of interest, normally seen in longer term savings plans, yet with easy instant access to your investment, as long as your balance remains over the pre-set limit.
 
 AVAILABILITY
 
 This account is available to all UK residents.
 
 
 HOW TO OPEN YOUR ACCOUNT
 
 Your Falcon 60 account can be opened at any Society Branch or Agency. If you are a new investor with the Society you will be asked to provide one form of personal identification and another for address verification. A list of the acceptable items is displayed in all Branches and Agencies and a copy will be made available on request. All requests for identification are standard and conform to regulations which protect you, the Customer, and guard against fraudulent transactions.
 
 MINIMUM INITIAL INVESTMENT
 
 The minimum investment required to open a Falcon 60 account, where you require annual interest, is £1,000. If you choose to take advantage of the monthly income option, the minimum requirement rises to £10,000. In both cases the maximum investment allowed in the account is £1,000,000.
 
 ADDING TO YOUR INVESTMENT
 
 You can add to your account at any time and the current rate of interest will be applied immediately. The Falcon 60 account offers tiered interest rates which start when your balance reaches £10,000 (Annual interest accounts only), £25,000 and £50,000. There is a significant step in rates at these levels.
 
 ACCESS TO YOUR INVESTMENT
 
 You have instant access to your savings without loss of interest, provided that after your withdrawal, your balance remains at £10,000 or above. Alternatively, you may give the Society 60 days notice of your intended withdrawal and you will not incur penalties.
 
 Should the balance in your account drop below £10,000, you may still take advantage of instant access, but the transaction will incur the loss of 60 days' interest as penalty.
 
 INTEREST PAYMENTS
 
 Annual Option - Interest is paid annually on the 31st December. This payment can be credited directly to the account or transferred to another suitable account with the Society.
 
 Monthly Income Option - Should you choose the option of taking a monthly income from your investment, interest will be paid on the last working day of every month, either by transfer to a suitable Society account or direct to your bank account. Current interest rates will be supplied to you on request and are on display at all Branch or Agency offices.
 
 INCOME TAX
 
 Interest will be paid after deduction of income tax at the lower rate or, subject to the required certification, gross. Registration forms are available from any of the Society's Branches or Agencies, or direct from the Inland Revenue. If you have Adobe Acrobat Reader click here to download the R85 form. If you are a non-taxpayer you will be able to claim repayment of this tax directly from the Inland Revenue. You can also claim a repayment of tax, if your taxable income falls within the starting rate band and you are eligible to pay less tax than the amount deducted from your interest. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.
 
 The Society is required to supply the Inland Revenue with details of all interest paid or credited to investors each year.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ISSUE
 
 
- INVESTMENTS: Each account is subject to a minimum investment of £1,000 (Annual Interest Option) or £10,000 (Monthly Interest Option - see note 6 below). Additional sums of any amount may be invested at any time up to the Society's maximum of £1,000,000.
 
 
- COOLING OFF PERIOD: If, after careful consideration, you decide that you are not happy with your choice of savings or investment account(s) and you bring this to our attention within 14 days of your initial receipt, we will help you to either switch accounts or return your money with any interest earned over that period*. We will ignore any notice periods and additional charges in these cases.
 
*Please note: Cheques paid in within the 14 day period will have to clear before a refund can be given.
 
 
- WITHDRAWALS: These are available with 60 days written notice with interest paid in full, or payable on demand with the loss of 60 days interest on the amount withdrawn. For notice withdrawals, a period of 7 days' grace is allowed at the end of the notice period, after which notice will have to be resubmitted if penalty interest is to be avoided.
 
Immediate penalty free withdrawals are available provided that a balance of £10,000, or more, remains in the account after withdrawal. Immediate withdrawals which take the account balance below £10,000 will be split and charged as follows:-
 
 
 
- The portion of the withdrawal between the existing balance and £10,000, will be penalty free, with the remainder of the withdrawal taking the balance below £10,000, incurring 60 day's loss of interest at the prevailing interest rate.
 
 
In practice the Society allows withdrawals up to £500 in cash or up to the account balance by cheque to be available immediately at any Branch Office. Withdrawals are also available at the Society's Agencies - up to £300 in cash and up to the account balance by cheque but prior notice may be required.
 
 
- INTEREST: This is calculated on a daily basis, including the day of receipt but excluding the day of withdrawal, and paid on 31st December (except for Monthly Income accounts - see note 6 below) each year. Interest may be paid to the account, or transferred to another suitable account with the Society.
 
Annual option: Interest may be credited to the account, or paid to another suitable account with the Society.
 
Monthly Option: Interest may be paid to another suitable account with the Society, paid direct to your bank account or credited to the account.
 
ADDITIONAL INTEREST becomes payable when an account balance reaches £10,000, £25,000 and £50,000 respectively. Conversely, when an account balance falls below these levels, the interest rate payable will be reduced accordingly.
 
PENALTY INTEREST is debited to the account, calculated on the amount withdrawn at the prevailing interest rates applicable to the tiered levels. The Society reserves the right to deduct any outstanding penalty/debit interest from the capital balance at the next interest date or at the date of closure. Penalty/debit interest arises when the amount of penalty/debit charged exceeds the amount of credit interest earned.
 
 
- INTEREST RATES: We reserve the right to amend interest rates at our discretion using one or more of the following methods:
 
 
- Advertisements in the Yorkshire Post and Derbyshire Times Newspapers
 
- Notice in Branch and Agency offices
 
- Individual notification to investors
 
- Internet - Society Website
 
 
- MONTHLY INCOME OPTION: This is available on accounts with balances of at least £10,000 and will be paid on the last day of each month either to a suitable account with the Society or to a bank account. Accounts will receive the first interest payment on the last day of the same month, unless they are opened within the last 5 working days of a month, in which case the initial interest payment will cover the period from the date the account is opened to the end of the following month. Thereafter, the amount of each monthly payment will be based on the number of days in the month.
 
If the balance of a Falcon 60 Monthly Income account falls below £10,000 monthly payments will be stopped and the balance transferred without penalty to a Falcon 60 account paying annual interest. However, if requested by the investor, the account may be transferred to another suitable account, but with the loss of 60 days' interest on the closing balance.
 
 
- AMENDMENTS: We reserve the right to amend Terms and Conditions of Issue at our discretion. Should the change be to your disadvantage, we will tell you about it personally at least 30 days before we make the change.
