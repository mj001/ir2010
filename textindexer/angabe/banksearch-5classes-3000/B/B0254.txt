 tax at 20%. * AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what 
 the interest would be if interest was paid and added each year. Tax-Free 
 means that interest payable is exempt from Income Tax. Gross means the rate 
 of interest payable before the deduction of income tax at the appropriate 
 rate. ~ Capital Instant Annual Interest - Golden Flexi Plus, High Yield Term Shares,
