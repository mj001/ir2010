Fixed 
 Rate Mortgage 
 
 
 
 A 
 fixed rate mortgage gives you the comfort of 
 knowing that your monthly payments will be fixed 
 for a period of time at the start of the mortgage 
 term. At the end of the fixed rate period, the 
 Society’s standard variable mortgage rate will 
 be applied. This may be either higher or lower 
 than the rate applied during the fixed rate 
 period. You should therefore, budget for the 
 possibility of higher payments.
