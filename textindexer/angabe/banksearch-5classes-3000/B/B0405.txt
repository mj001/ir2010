 This scheme is a mortgage or remortgage for landlords who are 
looking to borrow below our minimum loan (£15,001 to £25,000). This scheme has a 1% loading and, reflecting the market costs of wholesale money, moves in line with general trends of financial markets. This rate is fixed at 7.85% for 3 years and then reverts to 2.5% above 3 month LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offered Rate) which is reset quarterly in January, April, July & October. The current LIBOR rate applicable is 6.70%.

 Income Requirements
 
 
 
 Non Portfolio & Investment Applications: 
For let properties, up to 50% rental income may be added to the primary applicants annual income provided the amount does not exceed 20% of the individuals total income.
As a general rule, the maximum loan available will be assessed by applying the appropriate multiple(s) (see Mortgage Income Requirement Guidelines) to the annual income(s) determined and the resultant amount must cover the proposed mortgage loan and any other mortgages.
Portfolio Applications: 
Where the applicant owns three or more let properties and has more than 12 months lettings experience, then the maximum loan may be assessed on the basis that the gross rental income from the property must be equal or exceed 150% of the interest only payment calculated at the prevailing Lettings Variable Rate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Additional Requirements
 
 
 
 Three months bank statements are required with the application together with three most recent payslips, or last P60 (3 years accounts if self-employed) and two most recent annual mortgage statements. If future rental income is to be taken into account we will require a letter from a local letting agent confirming the estimated income.
Property insurance is required. Paragon do offer Paragon Privilege, a 2nd Property insurance covering buildings & contents, rental income cover and appliance breakdown.
* Full Homelet - £34.95 per property. We are not able to offer just buildings insurance alone.
* Homelet excluding Buildings Insurance - £29.95
* Full Payment Protection Insurance - protects against accident, sickness and redundancy @ £4.85 per month per £100 of your monthly mortgage payment.
Life insurance is at the discretion of the applicants and their advisers.

 The property will be valued on the basis of a single family dwelling, and valuation will include a deduction for any conversion costs.
There is no limit on height/storey for flats, subject to valuation.
If a property is split into more than 4/5 units, we must refer to our insurers for approval, and there could be an issue with valuation, as conversion costs may be very high.
