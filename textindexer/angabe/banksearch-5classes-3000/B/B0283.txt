We hope to explain clearly the process involved in taking out a mortgage - what we will expect from you and what you can expect from us.
 
 
 We do appreciate that your home is probably the most expensive single item you will purchase over the years, but that doesn't mean to say that the process should be a long, complicated one and certainly not one surrounded with legal jargon and shrouded in mystery.
 
 We have broken down the entire process into stages to allow you to see just how simple things can be. You should remember that you are the important one in the whole process and if there are things that you are not happy about or areas about which you are uncertain, please ask, we are here to help you. However simple the process might seem, you should remember that you would be purchasing your home by a process that could last for up to 25 years.
 
 
 If you are a first time buyer you have all the adaptability for quick and easy house purchase, but you need to make two decisions:
 
 
 
- HOW MUCH CAN I AFFORD TO SPEND ON MY NEW HOME?
 
This is best calculated upon what you can afford to spend monthly, although as a rule of thumb you can roughly calculate your total possible borrowing on the main earner's salary x 3, and if a partner is involved 1 x their salary
 
or
 
An alternative method for a joint mortgage is to add both salaries together nd multiply by 2.5.
 
 
 
- WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MORTGAGE AVAILABLE TO ME?
 
We would advise you to make an appointment with one of our mortgage advisers who will be happy to work through the options available and explain their associated costs and requirements.
 
 We offer a range of mortgage products available only to customers who contact us direct. These products are not available through intermediaries such as Independent Financial Advisers and Estate Agents.
 
 
 Once you are aware of the options, you can look at property for sale and choose one most suited to your requirements.
 
 
 Having found a home, the next steps are as follows:
 
 MAKE AN OFFER
 
 In the large majority of cases you need only communicate with the vendor through the Estate Agent. Should the Estate Agent require confirmation that you are eligible for a mortgage to cover the cost of the property, we will be pleased to supply a letter of intent for such occasions. This will be offered subject to satisfactory references.
 
 CHOOSE A SOLICITOR
 
 If you do not already have a solicitor, this need not be a problem, as we can suggest a number of local solicitors.
 
 Hopefully your offer will be accepted and your prospective home will now be classed as Sold - Subject to Contract.
 
 COMPLETE YOUR MORTGAGE APPLICATION
 
 Once your offer has been accepted, arrange to come into your branch for a mortgage interview and we will complete a mortgage application with you.
 
 Please note: You will need identification to complete the process. Please contact your local branch for details.
 
 ARRANGE FOR A PROPERTY VALUATION
 
 As part of our mortgage process we will carry out a property survey/valuation to ensure that the property offers adequate security for the proposed mortgage. At this stage you have the option of taking a more detailed survey.
 
 ISSUE OF THE MORTGAGE OFFER
 
 When we are completely satisfied with both the application and the value of the property we will offer the mortgage and set out all the terms and conditions of the loan. We will also send a set of instructions to your appointed solicitor.
 
 ARRANGING COMPLETION OF THE PURCHASE
 
 Once your solicitor is satisfied that all requirements have been met with i.e. searches, land registry etc, you will be asked to sign a contract which, when exchanged, legally binds you to the purchase of the property. You will then be required to pay a deposit of not less than 5% of the property cost and a completion date can be agreed.
 
 Your solicitor will obtain the loan cheque for the vendor’s solicitor from us and the sale will be complete.
 
 You are now the owner of your new home and you may collect the keys and move in.
 
 THE MAIN STEPS TO HOUSE PURCHASE
 
 
- VISIT YOUR SOCIETY for on initial discussion about the types of mortgage available to you and the amount you are able to borrow based on your financial circumstances.
 
- FIND YOURSELF A HOME. Estate agents are the best start but many people sell their homes privately too. Make an offer, Subject to Contract.
 
- Return to the Society to COMPLETE THE MORTGAGE FORMS. This gives us your authority to take references and status enquiries to substantiate the application.
 
- INSTRUCT YOUR SOLICITOR
 
- The Society will then INSTRUCT A VALUER TO VISIT THE PROPERTY and prepare a report on the status of the property.
 
- Subject to there being no problems following the valuer’s visit THE SOCIETY WILL ISSUE AN OFFER stating the full terms and conditions of the mortgage.
 
- SOLICITORS EXCHANGE CONTRACTS and advise on a completion date.
 
- Once payment of the cheque is received THE SALE IS COMPLETE leaving.....
 
- MOVING IN DAY! Collect the keys to your new home. We are here to offer support every step of the way, from initial discussion, through to completion.
 
 THE COST OF BUYING A NEW HOME
 
 The costs involved in the purchase of your home can vary considerably depending upon your personal circumstances. However, the main cost areas are as follows:
 
 
- MORTGAGE ARRANGEMENT FEE (if applicable)
 
- VALUATION OR SURVEY FEE (if applicable)
 
- THE DEPOSIT - this must be a minimum of 5% of the house price.
 
- HIGH PERCENTAGE LOAN FEE (if applicable) - This only applies when you are borrowing 85% or more of the property’s purchase price or valuation, whichever is the lower. The fee is debited to your mortgage account upon completion and should be paid as soon as possible thereafter.
 
- LEGAL COSTS - which will be agreed with the solicitor. Always ask for an all inclusive quotation to ensure you are aware of the full costs. Stamp Duty, if applicable, will be collected by your solicitor and is currently charged when the purchase price exceeds £60,000. Your solicitor will be able to advise you of the scale of rates that apply.
 
- REMOVAL COSTS - Don't forget to budget for the cost of moving your furniture, personal belongings etc. to your new home.
 
- RUNNING COSTS OF NEW HOME - At this stage it may be advisable to draw up a simple income and expenditure breakdown regarding the running cost of your new home, to allow you to budget for the new additional costs of a mortgage payment per month, as well as all the associated utility bills, which you will have quarterly or more frequently, depending upon your provider. Our mortgage advisers will be able to assist you with this.
 
 BUILDINGS AND CONTENTS INSURANCE
 
 As your home is probably your greatest expense to date, it makes sense to arrange comprehensive insurance to cover both the building and the valuable contents inside.
 
 Properties can sustain any amount of damage through things such as adverse weather conditions, vandalism, fire and freaks of nature, as can your contents through accidents, burglaries, water or fire damage. In the event of these circumstances occurring, all too often the distress caused by damage is compounded considerably by inadequate cover and protection. A simple rule is - if you value it - protect it.
 
 It is a mortgage requirement that your property’s materials - bricks and mortar etc, are adequately insured, but it makes sense to consider your other personal belongings too.
 
 We offer a comprehensive Buildings and Contents Insurance package. Our mortgage advisers will be happy to explain the product fully.
 
 MORTGAGE PROTECTION
 
 We can help give you the peace of mind of knowing that your mortgage would not be a burden to your dependents should you die, become seriously ill or incapacitated during the mortgage term.
 
 Our branch offices are able to provide instant quotations through our connection with Scottish Provident.
 
 Alternatively we can offer independent financial advice via Barnsley Building Society Financial Services Ltd*, thus giving you access to information from the wider market place.
 
 ACCIDENT, SICKNESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
 
 Unemployment insurance offers a solution to the unexpected problems within our lives we cannot control. For example, having gone to great lengths to determine how much you could afford to pay for your new home, finding the property and completing the purchase process, have you considered how you would continue to pay your mortgage if you suddenly became ill or lost your job? You may have hard earned savings set aside, but would you really want to use that money to keep things ticking over?
 
 Our Accident, Sickness and Unemployment insurance, written in conjunction with one of the UK’s leading Insurance Companies, has been designed to offer today’s homeowner peace of mind from the unknown in the future.
 
 If you have to be away from your work due to illness, accident or involuntary unemployment, your insurance cover will provide a monthly payment equal to the amount of benefit you choose when applying for your mortgage.
 
 The level of monthly benefit you choose comes in £10 blocks with a minimum amount of £100 up to a maximum of £1250. The amount you choose can be made up to cover mortgage related insurance premiums plus an additional 20% to cover the possibility of inflation.
 
 To be eligible for this insurance you must be under 65 and meet certain conditions regarding your employment at the time of applying for the scheme.
 
 Should you decide to increase the amount of your mortgage for whatever reason, your cover can be increased too. Similarly, should you decide to move house, cover can be rearranged to reflect your new mortgage payments.
 
 If you have a joint mortgage or your mortgage payments depend on more than one income, you may take out a joint policy where the monthly benefit is divided proportionately, or alternatively, you may choose to opt for a single policy under the name of the main income earner.
 
 Premiums are paid by direct debit to the insurance company.
