	 be extended to 40 years, but will be restricted to normal retirement 
	 age, unless proof of income is provided beyond this date.
	
 
	
- REPAYMENT METHOD - On all products, can be Interest 
	 Only or Repayment.

	 the mortgage term is from 5 to 24 years the minimum unexpired term of 
	 a lease must be 55 years.  Where the mortgage term is from 25 to 40 
	 years the minimum unexpired term of a lease must be the mortgage term 
	 plus 30 years.
	
 
	
- CCJs AND ARREARS - Please refer to your Chelsea 
	 contact for clarification.
	
 
	
- REPAYMENT OF CAPITAL - Interest will be charged 
	 on repayments of capital up to the end of the month in which the repayment 
	 is made. 
	 Portable - The Chelsea Mortgage product may be transferred 
	 to another property within the early repayment charge term without penalty. 
	 
	 Superportable - Should the borrower move home within 
	 the early repayment charge term, the borrower may apply for any of the 
	 Society’s product range without incurring an early repayment charge. 
	 
	 For product availability see the Early Repayment Charge column 
	 on the product page.
	
 
	
- LOANS OVER £150,000 - Where the 
	 price or value of the property is greater than £150,000 the maximum 
	 loan will be restricted to a lower loan to value than shown.  Please 
	 refer to table 10. 
	
 
	
- SCOTTISH CASES - No administration 
	 fees are payable in respect of purchase transactions in Scotland. 
	
 
	
- LENDING RISK FEE (MIG)
	 The Lending Risk Fee is not charged on loans up to 90% Loan to Value 
	 (LTV) (with the exception of Prospect Mortgage where LRF is charged 
	 on loans from 80% and Concept Mortgage where LRF is charged on loans 
	 from 75% LTV).  Where the Society agrees to exceed 90% LTV (the normal 
	 maximum), or 80% Prospect or 75% Concept, the Lending Risk Fee will 
	 be applied to the element of the loan over 75% LTV. 
	
	The Society offers 3 payment methods to choose from: 
	
	 
- Where the purchase price or valuation is no greater than £150,000 
	your client can spread the cost over a 12 month period. 
	 
- Your client can spread the cost over the life of the loan.  Interest 
	is payable on fees added to the loan. 
	 
- The Lending Risk Fee can be paid in a single payment by deduction 
	from the loan. 
	
	
The LRF can be determined by reference to the table below:

Additional Notes for Individual Products
	See Mortgage Product Guide 
	 
	
 
	
- EARLY REPAYMENT CHARGE - Cashback 
	 Mortgage 
	 If the mortgage is fully repaid within the first 6 years the 6% cashback 
	 will have to be repaid, unless at the same time a new Chelsea mortgage 
	 is taken out on a different property. 
	 
	
- If a Chelsea Cashback Movers’ Mortgage is taken out, the cashback 
	 will not have to be repaid at that time, but the early repayment 
	 terms of the Cashback Mortgage will instead apply to the new Mortgage 
	 for the rest of the original 6 years. 
	
	
- If any other Chelsea mortgage is taken out, the amount of the 
	 cashback to be repaid will be reduced by one sixth for each complete 
	 year that has passed since the mortgage was taken out.  If any other 
	 early repayment of capital is made within the first 6 years, the 
	 cashback will have to be repaid on a proportional basis (eg if the 
	 repayment represents 15% of the mortgage balance, 15% of the cashback 
	 will have to be repaid). 
	 
	
	 
	
- FLEXIPLAN MORTGAGE SPECIAL TERMS 
	 - Borrowers can reduce the term and total amount of interest they have 
	 to pay by making either regular or lump sum overpayments, or both, as 
	 and when they like.  Additionally, borrowers can, in any one calendar 
	 year, take payment holidays or make underpayments (not exceeding 2 months’ 
	 payments) provided they have made 6 consecutive monthly payments from 
	 commencement of the mortgage, the monthly payments have been met when 
	 due and the current balance outstanding on their mortgage is not greater 
	 than 90% of the value of their property. 
	
 
	
- RIGHT TO BUY - Up to 80% open 
	 market value, including extra for home improvements. 
	
 
	
- LET TO BUY - Up to 95% LTV for 
	 purchase of new principal residence.  Providing proposed rental income 
	 covers current mortgage then all of earned income can be used for assessment 
	 of new loan. 
	
 
	
- ADMINISTRATION FEES - On all 
	 products an administration fee of £245 is charged, of which £195 is 
	 payable on application and the balance is added by default to the loan 
	 (unless specified otherwise by the applicant).  Interest is payable 
	 on fees added to the loan. 
	
 
	
- ARRANGEMENT FEES - The arrangement 
	 fee for Concept, Buy To Let and Student Buy To Let Mortgages is £195 
	 which is added to the advance.  The arrangement fee for the Fixed Rate 
	 and Prospect Mortgages is £295 which is added to the loan by default 
	 (unless otherwise specified by the applicant).  Interest is payable 
	 on fees added to the loan.
