With the increasing numbers of respectable tenants needing family homes, or a base to live near their work, private landlords are doing well. If you want to buy a property with a view to letting it out at a competitive rate, then we take into account this income when calculating how much you can borrow (please note borrowers must be over 25). All our products now revert to Bank of England Base Rate ('Base') plus 1.75%.
