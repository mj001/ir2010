 	 A typical example - A 15-year interest only mortgage of £30,000 on a purchase price of £40,000 assuming a completion date of 31st December 2001. Monthly mortgage payments are 180 payments of £152.50. Total gross amount payable £57,940.01 includes valuation fee of £105.00, application fee of £250.00, chaps fee of £25.00, sealing fee of £75.00, deeds production fee of £30.00, capital repayment of £30,000 and accrued interest of £5.01. The example has been calculated using a rate of 6.1% for 180 months, APR 6.4%. A charge will be made if the mortgage is redeemed within 5 years of completion, equal to 2 months interest. In this example the charge would be £305.00. No charge will be levied if the loan is repaid to the death of a borrower.
