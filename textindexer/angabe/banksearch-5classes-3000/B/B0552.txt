**The Society's "free legals" offer is available in England and Wales and covers the 
Society's legal costs involved in a typical remortgage transaction. It will not cover any 
non standard costs - for example, the costs of insuring a defective title or cases where 
you require legal advice of your own. 
Your home will be used as security and must be adequately insured. The Society's 
minimum loan is £30,000 and maximum £200,000. If the loan is redeemed or capital 
repayments in excess of £1,000 per calendar year are made (other than capital 
repayments due under the mortgage) within the first 4 years a charge will be made 
based on 4% of the amount repaid during years 1 and 2, 3.5% in years 3 and 4. 
Available to those aged 18 and over. Subject to status and valuation. The Society 
reserves the right to withdraw this plan at any time. 
Teachers Building Society is a member of the Building Societies Association 
and subscribes to The Banking Code and The Mortgage Code. 
*Typical example 1: Based on an interest rate of 3.69% (APR 5.7%), a 0.75% 
discount, a 0.25% discount and the Society's Standard Variable Rate, a property with 
a value of £85,000 with a repayment mortgage of £50,000 will require 12 monthly 
payments of £258.05; 12 at £293.86; 24 at £308.81 and 252 at £316.41. The total 
amount payable over 25 years (300 payments) is £93,829.93.
Typical example 2: Based on an interest rate of 3.94% (APR 5.8%), a 0.75% 
discount, a 0.25% discount and the Society's Standard Variable Rate, a property with 
a value of £60,000 with a repayment mortgage of £50,000 will require 12 monthly 
payments of £265.03; 12 at £293.86; 24 at £308.81 and 252 at £316.41. The total 
amount payable over 25 years (300 payments) is £93,913.69. 
These examples are based on known information, taking into account the discount 
periods, the refund of the valuation fee and the free legals package; no account has 
been taken of any variation to the interest rate, nor of premiums on any policy(ies) 
which may be taken out in conjunction with the loan. Written quotations available 
on request.
