	Not too sure about what will happen to future mortgage rates? Will they creep back up or will they continue to go down in line with European rates? 
	Nobody knows, which is why we have introduced the 5-Year Capped Rate Mortgage that benefits you no matter what happens to rates.
	
	The Skipton Flexible 5-Year Capped Rate Mortgage has a variable rate so you will benefit from any future rate reductions. Plus, if rates go 
	up, we guarantee that you will pay no more than 6.50% until 30 June 2007 for loans up to 85% loan to value or 6.65% for loans up to 95% 
	loan to value. But, we will also give you a 2 year discount of up to 0.75% off the variable rate, which means you could only be paying 4.95% 
	(5.5% APR) initially for a mortgage of 85% loan to value.
	
	Key Benefits
	
	
- Capped rate of either 6.50% or 6.65% until 30 June 2007.

	Concessionary Discount Scheme+
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	Our Mortgage Discount Scheme is designed to reward long standing borrowers. Following your initial 2 year discount period it 
	offers a 0.3% discount off our variable rate (currently 5.70%) during years 3 and 4. Following this period the discount is 
	increased to 0.5% off the variable rate applicable to your mortgage at that time. Until 30 June 2007, you will pay the 
	discounted variable rate or the capped rate, whichever is the lower. So you can receive long-term benefits and value for the 
	term of the mortgage.

	Legal fees package
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	If you are looking to remortgage we will pay your legal fees if you use our Home Conveyancing Service (£250 cashback paid in Scotland) up to 85% loan to value. However, if your loan to value is higher and you are selling and/or purchasing a property we have a great fixed fee legal package. See our Skipton Home Conveyancing Service leaflet and ask your Mortgage Adviser for details now.
	 
	
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Free HPLF below 90% Loan To Value
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	If you wish to borrow more than 75% of the valuation or purchase price (whichever is the lower), the Society will charge you a High Percentage Loan Fee (HPLF). This fee will be used to protect the Society in the event that you default on your mortgage. 
	
	We will charge this fee as a one off premium which will be added to your mortgage account, even if it takes your total loan over 95%, and where the valuation or purchase price (whichever is the lower) is £40,000 or more. You can, if you choose, pay this so that it does not accrue interest as part of the loan.
	
	However for loans between 75% and 90% of the valuation or purchase price, you don't have to pay a penny as we will credit your mortgage account with an amount equivalent to the HPLF on completion.
	 
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	How much can I borrow?
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	Provided you have been in permanent employment for at least three months, we'll lend up to 3.5 times your annual salary. If you're applying in joint names, the whole of your partner's salary can be added too. Or you can borrow 2.75 times your combined incomes.

	Skipton Insurance
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	If you opt for a 5-Year Capped Rate Mortgage with an insurance through the Skipton, you can choose whichever of these three excellent policies best suits your requirements.
	 
	
	
	
	
	Option 1
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton House and Contents is the ideal policy if you require comprehensive cover for your home and its contents. What's more, your personal possessions are covered automatically and the contents of your home are covered against accidental damage too. Make sure you ask for details of how you can receive 6 months Skipton Assured cover absolutely FREE when you take out this policy. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 2
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton Homeplan provides cover for your home and contents with a fixed level of contents cover of £30,000 - ideal if you require a limited level of cover. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 3
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton Assured provides security and peace of mind should you be unable to work through accident, sickness or unemployment. You really should think about taking out this essential payment protection insurance in addition to one of the household insurances. 
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Mortgage Advice
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	Under the Code of Mortgage Lending Practice, lenders may either provide customers with advice or give information on the mortgage products available. We believe that choosing your mortgage is one of the most important decisions that you are ever likely to make, and we will advise you on what we feel is the most suitable product from our range to meet your needs. 
	
	So when you're ready to talk over your application, if you do not have your own Financial Adviser, just call into your local Skipton branch. Alternatively you can call Customer Service on 01756 705035.*
	 
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Complaints Procedure
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	If you are not happy with our service, we have an internal complaints procedure. You should ask for details of this procedure at a branch or from our Principal Office.
	
	Complaints we cannot settle may be referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
	 
	
	
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Further Information
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	
	
- A fee of £295 is required. This can be added to the mortgage on completion, and it will incur interest as part of the loan, or you can pay it up front.
	
- To take advantage of the 0.75% (up to 85% LTV) and 0.60% (up to 95% LTV) discount, you need to take one of the three insurance policies detailed overleaf, which must be maintained until 30 June 2007.
	
- Monthly payments must be made in advance by Direct Debit on the 1st of each month. The interest rates quoted include a 0.25% Direct Debit discount. If the Direct Debit is cancelled, this discount is removed.
	
- You can make a capital repayment of up to 10% of the original loan each year without charge until 30 June 2007.
	
- Any capital repayment greater than 10% of the original loan made before 30 June 2003 will be subject to a charge of 5% of the capital repaid, 4% until 30 June 2004, 3% until 30 June 2005, 2% until 30 June 2006 and 1% until 30 June 2007.
	
- If the mortgage is repaid in full on or before 30 June 2003, there will be an early redemption charge of 5% of the balance of the mortgage, 4% before 30 June 2004, 3% until 30 June 2005, 2% until 30 June 2006 and 1% until 30 June 2007.
	
- If the mortgage is repaid in full after 30 June 2007, interest up to the end of the month of redemption will be payable.
	
- If you move house on or before 30 June 2007, the mortgage product is portable and can be applied to the new mortgage. (Please note: Any Concessionary Mortgage Scheme Discount is not portable.)
	
- If you exercise portability and the mortgage required for the new property is lower than the balance on the existing mortgage on or before 30 June 2007, a capital repayment fee will be payable on the difference between the loans as detailed above.
	
- Minimum acceptable property value £25,000.

	NB The valuer's report is for mortgage purposes only and does not guarantee that the property is free from defects.
	
	If you are purchasing a property and you require a Home Buyers Report and a Building Survey, please ask an adviser for details.
	
	+ It is intended that the Scheme will continue in force for the remainder of the term of the mortgage although the Board of Directors of the Society do have the right in their discretion to vary the terms of the Concessionary Scheme or to withdraw or to vary the amount of the scheme discount at any time.
	
	If they do so they will give you reasonable advance notice. The present view of the Board is that they would only be likely to do so as a result of exceptional circumstances arising from major changes in market conditions or general building society, banking or other lending practice.
	
	++High Percentage Loan Fees (HPLF) are used to provide extra security to protect the Society if you default on your mortgage and your property is taken into possession and is sold for less than you owe. This will protect the Society but it does not protect you. You will remain liable to pay all sums owing, including arrears, interest and our legal fees. If a claim is paid to the Society under a third party insurance, paid for out of the HPLF, the insurers will normally have the right to recover this amount from you.
