The
 Mortgage Code provides protection for residential
 mortgage borrowers.
 
It
 sets out minimum standards which mortgage lenders
 and intermediaries have to meet.
 
Cumberland
 Building Society has adopted The Mortgage Code (our
 registration number is 5384820) and will help you
 to choose a mortgage by providing the level of service
 most suited to your needs. The three levels of service
 we offer are:
 
 
- advice
 and a recommendation
 on which of the mortgages we provide is most suitable
 for you; (we are only able to offer this level of service
 to prospective borrowers who are able to visit one
 of our branches for a personal interview)
 
- information
 on the different types of mortgage
 products we offer so that you can make an informed
 choice of which to take; or
 
- information
 on a single mortgage product only, if
 only one mortgage is available or if you have already
 made up your mind.
 
 
Further
 details including an introductory leaflet 'You
 and your Mortgage - The Mortgage Code' will automatically
 be sent to you if you ask for information on our mortgage
 offers. A copy of this leaflet can also be viewed
 on the Council of Mortgage Lenders Website www.cml.org.uk
 
Alternatively
 you may obtain further details from any of our branches.
