*The Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) illustrates what 
 the interest rate would be if interest was paid and added to the account 
 each year. 
 
&#134; Subject to the required Inland Revenue certification 
 interest will be paid gross. In the absence of valid certification and 
 for those investors not ordinarily resident in the UK for tax purposes, 
 interest will be paid net at the applicable rate of tax, currently 20%. 
 Some or all of this tax may be reclaimed from the Inland Revenue by non-taxpayers.
