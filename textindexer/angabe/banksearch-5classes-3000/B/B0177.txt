 Early Repayment Terms
 See individual incentives above. Early repayment 
 charges also apply to capital repayments.
 A capital repayment is a lump sum payment of an amount equal to, or 
 in excess of, six monthly payments. 
 
 
 
 Higher Lending Charge 
 This charge is applicable for mortgages in 
 excess of 80% of the purchase price or value (whichever is the lower). 
 The charge can be added to the mortgage provided that the total loan 
 to value ratio does not exceed 97.5%. 
 
 
 
 Interest Rate
 Minimum rate of 0.1% will apply. The Society's 
 basic variable residential mortgage interest rate is currently 5.74%. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Unemployment/Redundancy Protection
 The Society will provide FREE 
 insurance for one year (subject to eligibility).
 
 
 Arrears Management
 If the account falls into arrears during the fixed rate period, 
 the Society may, at its discretion, vary the interest rate applicable 
 to the amount outstanding under the mortgage to its variable mortgage 
 rate. 
 
All mortgage products are available to applicants who are either 18 
 years or older.
 Your home will be taken as security for any loan advanced to you 
 by the Society. Your home is at risk if you do not keep up repayments 
 on the mortgage or any other loan secured on it.
