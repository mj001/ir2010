 the valuation fee is based on the valuation. 
 
 
 
 When additional inspections are required, 
 an additional valuation fee of £30 will be payable for each inspection. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ADDITIONAL SECURITY PROTECTION/MIG
 
 
 
 
 
 It must be remembered that your home will be security 
 for a mortgage loan. 
 
 
 The Society will require that the property is insured 
 against fire and other risks for its full replacement value for 
 the duration of the mortgage. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example:
 
 A couple wish to purchase for £35,000 
 a house valued at £35,000. They have saved a deposit of 
 £1,750 and so require a loan of £33,250, being 95% of the 
 valuation of the house. As the loan will be in excess of 
 75% of valuation (i.e. 75% of £35,000 = £26,250) a single 
 charge, to cover the costs of Additional Security Protection, 
 will be incurred for the additional amount of £7,000 (i.e. 
 33,250 - £26,250). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For loans above 90% of valuation or purchase price (whichever 
 is the lower), the extra amount incurs a single charge to cover 
 the costs of Additional Security Protection for the Society. 
 The rate of interest charged on your loan is not affected by 
 the Additional Security Protection.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For loans above 75% of valuation or purchase price 
 (whichever is lower), Additional Security Protection/MIG will 
 be required. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Loans up to 90% LTV
 
 
 
 The cost of the Additional Security 
 Protection/MIG is paid by the Society.
 
 
 
 
 
 Loans over 90% LTV
 
 
 
 £7.87 per £100 of protection is 
 paid by the borrower 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example:
 
 The couple in the last example 
 requiring a loan in excess of 75% of valuation by £7,000 
 on a total loan over 90% of valuation would incur a single 
 protection charge of £550.90 (i.e. 70 x £7.87). 
 
 
 
 
 
 The insurer has the right to recover any amount 
 paid under the policy from the homebuyer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CURRENT MORTGAGE PRODUCTS
 
 
 
 
 
The current standard base mortgage interest rate charged on 
 all new mortgages for house purchase, further advances and refinancing 
 on owner occupied properties is 5.74%.
 
 
 
 The rate of interest charged on all mortgages may 
 vary at any time during the agreed term. Examples shown in this 
 page relate to the current rate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 MAXIMUM HOME PURCHASE LOANS 
 ON PROPERTIES
 
 
 
 
 
 The amount you may borrow also depends upon the value 
 of the property. Your local Branch will give advice on the exact 
 amount the Society can offer on your specific property, but as 
 a general guide, the maximum loan will be:

 * A single charge for Additional Security Protection 
 is made for loans in excess of 75% of valuation or purchase price 
 (whichever is the lower). However, if you borrow 90% or less, 
 the Society will pay the charge. 
 
 
 ! Loans in excess of 95% valuation or purchase price 
 (whichever is the lower) will normally not be available, except 
 in special circumstances. 
 
 
 Each case will be considered on an individual basis. 
 
 
 ¬The maximum loan may normally be increased above 
 these levels to include the Additional Security Protection charge. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 REDEMPTION
 
 
 
 The loan may be repaid in full or in part at any 
 time. The Society will normally charge 14 days' interest except 
 where a loan is repaid within the first twelve months following 
 completion without a new loan taken from the Society, in which 
 case 1% interest is then normally charged. These terms do not 
 apply where the conditions of a particular mortgage product specify 
 alternative redemption charges. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 LOYALTY MORTGAGE RATE
 
 
 
 The Society provides a loyalty rate for long standing 
 borrowers, subject to qualification. Full details are available 
 on request from any branch or Head Office. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE 
 (APR) 
 
 
 
 This is the rate charged on a loan calculated to 
 a set formula. It includes not just the rate of interest but 
 also associated costs. It is standard practice to calculate 
 interest on the balance of the mortgage outstanding at the start 
 of each year, but payments are required monthly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 BUILDINGS INSURANCE
 
 
 
 The property must be insured for the duration of 
 the mortgage. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CASHBACK
 
 
 
 Where a mortgage product offers cashback, this 
 will be paid on completion of the loan. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 RE-MORTGAGES
 
 
 
 To take advantage of the benefits of re-mortgaging 
 with the Staffordshire you must already be a home owner. You 
 could borrow up to 90% of the value of your home, subject to 
 valuation and an appraisal of your financial standing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 SOLICITORS FEES
 
 
 
 You will need to appoint a solicitor to take care 
 of all of the legal aspects of arranging a mortgage. We recommend 
 that you obtain quotations from two or three before proceeding, 
 as charges may vary.
