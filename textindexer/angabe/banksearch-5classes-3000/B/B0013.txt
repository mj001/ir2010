Please Note:
AER stands for the Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if interest was paid and 
added each year (excluding bonuses). On all accounts except Tessa, Tessa 2nd Issue, Follow-up-Tessa, Save-As-You-Earn, 
Fairness ISA, ISA 90, Tessa-Only ISA (2nd Issue), New Century ISA, and Tessa-Only ISA interest will normally be paid 
at the net rate after deduction of income tax at the appropriate rate (currently 20%). Tax may be reclaimed from the 
Inland Revenue where the amount deducted exceeds the account holders liability to tax. Interest may be paid at the 
gross rate, without deduction of tax to account holders who are eligible and register that they do not expect to be 
liable to income tax and in certain other cases. Customers liable to higher rate tax may have to pay additional 
income tax to the Inland Revenue. All rates quoted are variable. Net rates have been rounded and are for 
illustrative purposes only. Rates correct at time of going to press. Withdrawals subject to branch and agency 
limits. Details of account conditions, when interest is paid and rates of interest of all other accounts are available 
from your local branch or by calling our customer advice line.
