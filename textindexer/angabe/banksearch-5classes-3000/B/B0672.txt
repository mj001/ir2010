	Reasons to use TMB
	
	Flexible Products and Flexible Approach
	
	
	
	TRUE SELF-CERTIFICATION 
	 
	NEW CAPITAL RAISING 
	
	
	This could allow clients to apply without proof of income, freeing them from the restriction of many conventional lenders to maximise their borrowing potential. Up to 80% LTV APR 6.2 is available to self-employed people after just one year’s trading. 
	 
	For loans up to £250,000 the Capital Raising limit is available up to £150,000 to 90% LTV APR 6.2 - except for Credit Repair where it is limited to the lower of £50,000 or 50% of the current valuation. Higher amounts by prior referral.
	
 
	
	
	NO CREDIT SCORING 
	 
	REMORTGAGES 
	
	
	Each application is individually underwritten.
	
 
	 
	TMB offer remortgages up to 95% LTV APR 6.2 for most purposes.
	
 
	
	FEE REDUCTION OPTION 
	 
	RATES CALCULATED WITH 'AUSTRALIAN METHOD' (DAILY INTEREST) 
	
	We will deduct the surrender value of any existing endowment policies from the amount of the advance upon which a HPA fee is payable, if the policy is assigned to us, reducing expenses for your client.
	
 
	 
	The interest on the outstanding mortgage balance is calculated daily, giving your clients full credit for any capital repayments from the day the repayments are made. 
	
	
	PORTABLE RATES 
	 
	FLEXI INVESTMENT PRODUCTS 
	
	
	Any product taken out by your client is fully portable which means your client can carry the mortgage if they move home again. Any preferential introductory rate they enjoy can be transferred (subject to satisfactory account conduct).
	
 
	 
	Flexible facilities on Next Move, House2House and Ten to Let ensure that your portfolio is even better to offer to your clients.
 
	
	
	MONTHLY IN ARREARS PAYMENTS 
	 
	PRESTIGE SERVICE 
	
	
	This could provide the client with a significant cashflow advantage.
	
 
	 
	Available for loans exceeding £500,000. Contact your local Business Development Manager for details. Alternatively call the dedicated Prestige team on 08457 253 253.
	
 
	
	
	LIFESTYLE PRODUCTS 
	 
	 
	
	
	Products that are well suited for the changing lifestyles of your clients.
