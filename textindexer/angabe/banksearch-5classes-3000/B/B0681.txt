 APR 5.4% variable; rate correct as at 1 December 2001. Typical Example: a repayment mortgage for £50,000
 over period of 25 years on a property valued at £70,000. The gross monthly payments for
 the first 36 months will be £263.90 and 264 months at £310.62. The APR, the
 monthly payments and the total amount payable have been calculated on the assumption that
 the variable mortgage rate will remain constant throughout the term of the mortgage. At
 the end of the three year discount period the Society&#146;s variable mortgage rate then
 applicable will apply. The total amount payable will be £91,713.58 which includes a
 valuation fee of £155 (paid to an external valuer) refundable on completion, estimated
 legal fees of £164.50, completion fee of £25 and a redemption fee of £40. If the amount
 borrowed exceeds 75% of the property purchase price or valuation (whichever is lower) a
 Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee fee is payable. Full written quotations are available on
 request. Security in the form of a legal mortgage over the property will be required.
 Mortgages are only available to persons over the age of 18 and are subject to status.
