 If you already have a mortgage with 
 us but want to extend or improve your home, we would be happy to consider 
 a further advance. Subject to the current value of your home being 
 sufficient, this advance could cover the cost of this work. Similarly, 
 if you have a mortgage with another lender, you should consider moving 
 it to us and combining it with your further advance. The chances are 
 that your monthly repayments may be reduced in the process.
