	 	MATURITY
	 	
	 	The 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I) will mature on the first anniversary from the date of opening and the balance will automatically transfer to a Scarborough 7 by Post Account. After transfer, the interest rate you will receive will be the prevailing rate for the appropriate balance of the Scarborough 7 By Post Account at that time.
When your 55 day Access Bond by Post (Issue I) matures and transfers to a Scarborough 7 By Post Account, the notice period will reduce to that set out in the Terms and Conditions for Scarborough 7 By Post (currently 7 days). Copies of these are available on this website, or on request. 
The Society will notify you in writing prior to your account maturing.

	 	INTEREST
	*Interest will be paid or credited after deduction of income tax at the lower rate of 20% or, subject to the required certification, gross.
**AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if interest was paid and added each year. (As every advertisement for a savings product which quotes an interest rate will contain an AER, you will be able to compare more easily what return you can expect from your savings over time.) If you do make a withdrawal from this account without giving 55 days' notice, you will lose 55 days' gross interest on the amount of the withdrawal. If you place more than one notice on your account prior to maturity, the interest rate will be reduced by 1.50% gross for a 55 day period. This means that the stated rate of interest will not be achieved. Please note that, if monthly interest is not added to your account, then the AER will not be achieved.
 	
	 	GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
	These terms and conditions (and those contained in the Scarborough Building Society general investment conditions) together with the Scarborough Building Society Memorandum and Rules set out the contractual relationship between Scarborough Building Society ('the Society'), and you, the member.
These conditions contain important information and should be read by you before you open an account with the Society. These conditions are available on this site by clicking on Other Information. 
 	
	 	OPENING AN ACCOUNT
	The minimum investment required to open a 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I) is £5,000.
The maximum amount which may be invested in a 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I) upon opening and during the life of the account is £250,000. This includes any interest which is credited to the account.
The Society reserves the right to close your 55 Access Bond By Post (Issue I) if the balance falls below £5,000.
The initial payment and any subsequent payments to your 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue 1) will only be accepted in the form of a cheque or transfer from an existing Society investment account.
This is a share account and on opening the account, the account holder(s) will become an investing member(s) of the Society, in accordance with its Rules.
 	
	 	PROOF OF IDENTITY
	Proof of identity and verification of address are required for all applicants. Two original documents, not more than three months old are required for each investor, photocopies are not acceptable. The documents will be returned to you and should be either:
- Utility bill (e.g. Gas/Electricity)
- Bank/Building Society Statement
- Current Council Tax/Notice of Tax Coding
and MUST show the name and address of the investor as it appears on the application form. Further verification checks may be carried out by the Society.
If you already have an account with the Society bearing your current address, identification is not required.
Unless proof of identity is provided, and all appropriate sections of the application form have been completed, including date of birth, we will return your investment to you.
 	
	 	INTEREST
	Interest may, on your written instructions, be paid monthly/annually either to a designated bank or building society account, added to the balance of your 55 Day Access Bond by Post (Issue 1), or transferred monthly/annually to another Scarborough Building Society account. If the balance of your 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue 1) falls below £5,000, or you do not request to have your interest paid monthly, interest will be paid annually on 1 May. The Society reserves the right to change the date on which interest is credited to your account.
Interest which is payable monthly will be credited to your 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I) or your designated bank or building society account on the first working day of each calendar month.
If the balance of your 55 Day Access Bond by Post (Issue I) falls below £5,000, the interest rate payable for the period that the balance remains below £5,000, will be the Society's variable base savings rate applicable at the time. Details are available on request.
All rates are variable, and the gross monthly rates do not normally compound to the full annual rates shown.
 	
	 	GIVING NOTICE
	55 days’ notice must be given to withdraw/transfer funds from, or close your Scarborough 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I). Notice can be given in writing or by telephone. The Society will confirm the amount you have placed on notice in writing and the date on which the funds will be withdrawn/transferred from your account, or your account closed. Any request to cancel or reduce the amount on notice must be received by the Society at least two full working days before the confirmed transaction date. This request can be given by telephone or in writing. All notice requests will be treated as withdrawal requests unless otherwise stated.
No notice of withdrawal or transfer is permitted during the first 55 days from the date of opening the account (excluding the 14 day cooling off period). Closure is permitted in accordance with the 2nd paragraph in the Withdrawals and Additional Investments section.
If you deposit further investments in your 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I), after placing your account on notice to close, withdraw from or transfer your account, then a separate notice instruction must be received by the Society.
Withdrawals or transfers to other Society accounts or closure of your account are permitted without giving 55 days’ notice. However, a charge of 55 days’ gross interest will be applied to the amount withdrawn/transferred or the balance, if closed. If you place more than one notice on your account prior to maturity, the interest rate will be reduced by 1.50% gross for a 55 day period.
 	
	 	WITHDRAWALS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS
	Your 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I) cannot be operated through any of the Society's branches.
Access during the first 55 days from the date of opening the account is by closure and will be subject to a penalty equivalent to 55 days' gross interest on the balance of the account (apart from during the 14 day cooling off period).
After the first 55 days from the date of opening the account, you may, on giving 55 days' notice, make one withdrawal, transfer from, or close your account, without any loss of interest. Where subsequent notice is given to either withdraw/transfer or close your 55 Day Access Bond by Post (Issue I), the interest rate applicable to your 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I) will be reduced by 1.50% gross for the 55 day period, either in relation to the amount which is being withdrawn/transferred or the balance of the account if notice has been given to close your account. Once notice has been given you may withdraw it, or fail to act upon it, but it will still be regarded as a notice under the terms of the account, and the amount deducted will not be refunded.
The Society may, from time to time, vary the interest rate reduction charge applicable to your 55 Day Access Bond by Post (Issue I), in accordance with its General Investment Conditions. You are advised to request details of the amount of reduction in interest before giving notice on your 55 Day Access Bond By Post (Issue I).
This account does not offer cheque withdrawals payable to a third party. All cheques will be made payable to one or all of the account holders and sent to the last address on record.
