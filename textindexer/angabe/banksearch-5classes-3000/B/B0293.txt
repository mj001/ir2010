 Cash 
 Mini ISA 
 
 
 1. 
 
 In accordance with ISA regulations, the maximum amount which 
 can be paid into the cash mini ISA is £3,000 in each tax year until 5th April 2006. 
 In addition the Society requires that your initial investment 
 is for a minimum of £500. Once the maximum annual subscription 
 limit has been reached, no further subscriptions may be made 
 in that tax year. 
 
 
 2. 
 
 The Society will not accept investments into this account which 
 could be designated as maturing TESSA funds under ISA regulations. 
 
 
 
 3. 
 
 If the balance in the cash mini ISA falls below £500, the account 
 will automatically be closed by cheque made payable to the Account 
 Holder. The account will be subject to the interest penalty 
 stated in Conditions 9 & 11 on the amount withdrawn. 
 
 
 4. 
 
 Cash mini ISA account holders must be aged 16 years or over. 
 
 
 
 5. 
 
 Cash mini ISA accounts may not be held in joint names. 
 
 
 6. 
 
 Individuals 
 who open a Darlington Building Society cash mini ISA cannot 
 also open a maxi ISA, or another cash mini ISA with any ISA 
 provider, in that same tax year. They are however eligible to 
 open a Stocks and Shares mini ISA and/or an Insurance mini ISA 
 with another ISA provider. In addition they may hold a TESSA 
 or TESSA only ISA with the proceeds from a matured TESSA account. 
 
 
 
 7. 
 
 The 
 interest earned is calculated daily and is added to the account 
 annually on 31st March. 
 
 
 8. 
 
 Investments 
 and withdrawals can be made at any branch or agency subject 
 to individual branch or agency withdrawal limits. 
 
 
 9. 
 
 Withdrawals may be made subject to an interest penalty equivalent 
 to 30 days loss of gross interest on the amount withdrawn. After 
 the fifth anniversary of the account, withdrawals can be made 
 without loss of interest if 30 days notice has been given. Withdrawals 
 may be made without 30 days notice subject to the above interest 
 penalty. The full 30 days penalty will apply in all circumstances 
 where the full 30 days notice is not given. Investors will normally 
 be allowed five working days after the 30 day notice period 
 has ended in which to effect a withdrawal. If the withdrawal 
 is not made within this period, the Society will deem that the 
 withdrawal is not required and the notice of withdrawal will 
 lapse. 
 
 
 10. 
 
 Withdrawals from, or closure of, the cash mini ISA will not 
 result in the loss of its special tax free status. 
 
 
 11. 
 
 Transfer 
 of the cash mini ISA to another ISA provider will be subject 
 to the penalty stated under Condition 9, plus an additional 
 fee of £30. 
 
 
 12. 
 
 The 
 Society will not accept transfers into the Darlington Building 
 Society cash mini ISA from other ISA providers. 
 
 
 13. 
 
 Should 
 the holder of a cash mini ISA die, the account will cease to 
 be a cash mini ISA from the date of death, but interest credited 
 or accrued up to that date will be paid gross. 
 
 
 14. 
 
 The cash mini ISA investment will be, and must remain in, the beneficial ownership of the Account Holder and must not be used as security for a loan. 
 
	 
 15. 
 
 Darlington Building Society will notify the Account Holder if, by reason of any failure to satisfy the provisions of the ISA regulations the cash mini ISA has, or will, become void. 
 
 
 
 
 THE DARLINGTON BUILDING SOCIETY ISA DOES NOT COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT 
 CAT STANDARDS WHICH REFER TO COST, ACCESS AND TERMS.
THE FAVOURABLE TAX TREATMENT OF ISAS IS NOT GUARANTEED AND MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

 only persons eligible to open a TESSA only ISA are holders of 
 Darlington Building Society TESSA accounts or members of Darlington Building Society (and who were members on 31 December 2000) who have held a TESSA account with another provider. A Maturity Certificate will be required as proof of holding. The

 the final sum subscribed to the matured TESSA, providing a minimum 
 balance of £500 is credited to the account upon opening. The 
 balance in your TESSA only ISA may subsequently be topped up 
 to the final sum subscribed to the TESSA, providing this is 
 done within six months of the TESSA maturity date.
