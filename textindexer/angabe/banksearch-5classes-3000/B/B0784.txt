Acorns Children's Hospice Trust
 
Acorns is a children's hospice that cares for life limited children and 
 their families across the West Midlands region, although they'll welcome 
 your help no matter where you are. Acorns offers both practical help and 
 emotional support to families at home, 24 hours a day, as well as respite 
 and palliative care at one of the hospices, in Walsall and Selly Oak.
 
A 
 registered charity, Acorns is largely dependant on donations. Acorns has 
 helped over 800 families since it was established in 1988. It is thought 
 that up to 1,000 families in the West Midlands may need help at any one 
 time.
