 PRODUCT BENEFITS
	 
	 
	 
	 
 
 Overpayments
	 
	 Borrowers can pay more than their normal monthly repayments to their 
	 mortgage (overpayments)
	 
	 Overpayments can be either regular or one off payments and can be for a 
	 regular amount or at a borrower's discretion 
	 
	 Borrowers can have a refund of overpayments at anytime, (subject to a 
	 minimum of £500) either by cheque or transfer into a Furness investment 
	 account or suspend their monthly repayments (payment holiday)
	 
	 Underpayments
	 
	 Borrowers can pay less than their normal monthly repayments to their 
	 mortgage (underpayments)
	 
	 Underpayments are allowed up to the amount of previous overpayments, are 
	 subject to prior approval by the Society and will increase the interest 
	 charged to the mortgage
	 
	 Payment holidays
	 
	 Borrowers can take a break from making monthly repayments, but only if 
	 they have previously made overpayments
	 
	 Payment holidays are available up to the amount of previous overpayments 
	 and are subject to prior approval by the Society and will increase the 
	 interest charged to the mortgage
	 
	 Flexible borrowing
	 
	 A "drawdown" limit is agreed with the borrower to allow them to borrow at 
	 any time for any purpose (subject to a minimum of £500)
	 
	 The "drawdown" limit is linked to the mortgage and the total amount 
	 borrowed will not exceed 90% of the value of the property
	 
	 Flexible payments
	 
	 Borrowers can make their annual repayments over ten months instead of 
	 twelve and they can make their mortgage repayments weekly, monthly, 
	 quarterly or even annually
	 
	 Flexible term
	 
	 Borrowers who make capital repayments can adjust the term of their mortgage 
	 up and down thereby altering their monthly repayment
	 
	 Once a repayment has been chosen the term of the mortgage will be agreed;
	 similarly once the term of the mortgage has been chosen the repayment will 
	 be agreed
	 
	 Interest rate guarantee
	 
	 The Society guarantees the variable interest rate charged on the account
	 will not exceed 1% above the Bank of England base rate.
