 Product Description
 
 The basic mortgage rate that we offer is the standard variable rate (SVR). 
 This generally moves up and down according to the Bank of England base rate 
 changes. Special rate deals revert to the standard variable rate at the 
 end of the 'discounted' or 'fixed' rate period. You will pay at the standard 
 variable rate if you do not qualify for any of our preferential products 
 or if you want to pay your mortgage over a short term.

LTV
 (Loan to Value)
 
LTV is the amount you want to borrow expressed 
 as a % of the purchase price or valuation of the property, whichever 
 is the lower. E.g. If the purchase price and valuation is £100,000 
 and you want to borrow £95,000 this would be 95% LTV.
