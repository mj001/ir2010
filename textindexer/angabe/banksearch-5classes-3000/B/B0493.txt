A) 
 For what purposes are residential mortgages available? 
 
Residential mortgages are available for the following purposes; 
 
 1) Purchase of a residential property 
 
 2) Remortgage of an existing advance. 
 
 3) Capital raising 
 
 4) Construction of a property which the applicant will 
 occupy on completion. 
 
 
 
B) 
 What is the maximum percentage of the purchase 
 price that you would advance? 
 
 The maximum loan we will advance is as follows; 
 
 1) For home purchase and re-mortgage, 95% of the 
 price of the valuation of the property, whichever is the lower. For certain 
 products the maximum loan may be restricted. There is also a restriction 
 on properties worth more than £250,000.00. 
 
 2) Re-mortgage for capital raising purposes are not 
 permitted on mortgages above 75% loan to value. Capital raising is 
 described as anything other than the replacement of a home purchase loan 
 or a loan for the purposes of home improvement. In certain circumstances 
 the loan to value can be increased to 85%. 
 
 3) Second homes/holiday homes must be strictly for 
 the sole use of the borrower and dependent family members and must not 
 be let. The maximum loan to value for such properties is 75% and applicants 
 financial status must be sufficient to cover both loans (i.e. mortgage 
 on first property plus new mortgage). 
 
 4) For the construction of a residential property, 
 for owner occupation, 85% of cost or value of the property, whichever 
 is the lower. The maximum for the purchase of land is 75%. 
 
 All applicants must find their deposit from their own 
 resources - it cannot be borrowed from another party. 
 
 
 
C) How do you calculate 
 how much I/we can borrow? 
 
 The maximum loan we will advance is subject to the following 
 multiples; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loan to Value 
 
 Multiple 
 of first income plus 1 x second 
 Joint 
 Income 
 
 
 Up to

 Income x 2.5

 The 
 details above are subject to the applicant being a minimum of 25 years 
 old. If the applicant is under 25 years of age, maximum over 75% is 3x. 
 Regular monthly commitments will be deducted from income.

 3) Self employed applicants applying for a loan of more 
 than 50% of the property value must also provide the last six months'

H) What is the maximum term over 
 which I can take my mortgage? 
 
The normal term for a mortgage is 25 years, however the 
 Society may consider a term up to 35 years. For further details please 
 contact our branch or Newcastle Direct. 
 
 
 
I) If I pay by 
 Direct Debit, when will my first mortgage payment become due, following 
 completion? 
 
 Should completion of your mortgage take place prior to 
 the 15th of the month, the Society will collect your monthly payment on 
 the 1st of the following month. If completion takes place after the 15th, 
 your first payment will be collected on the 15th of the following month 
 and will then continue to be collected on the 1st of each month thereafter. 
 
 
 
J) Can a Risk charge 
 premium be added to my loan? 
 
The Society insure all loans over 75%, but a premium is 
 only payable where the loan to value is 85% or greater e.g. on a loan 
 of 86% the risk charge will represent 11% i.e. the difference between 
 75% and 86%, and not 1% being the amount over 85%. 
 
Applicants borrowing over 85% of value/purchase price are 
 asked to pay a Risk Charge. This can be added to the loan amount. The 
 level of the charge varies according to the amount borrowed, as per the 
 following table. There is a minimum premium of £50.00.

K) 
 Does the Society offer any incentives to loyal 
 borrowers? 
 
 Those borrowers who have been with the Society for a full 
 five calendar years or more are eligible for a discount from our variable 
 base rate on the 1 January following their fifth anniversary. This discount 
 is subject to fluctuation at the discretion of the Society. 
 
 This loyalty discount is not applicable to borrowers in 
 arrears or those customers already benefiting from one of the Newcastle's 
 special mortgage schemes (e.g. Fixed Rate, cash back, discount or capped). 
 
 
 
L) If my loan is 
 subject to the Consumer Credit Act, can the 'cooling off' period be waived? 
 
 No. Under the terms of the Consumer Credit Act, a seven 
 day cooling off period must be given, to allow customers to review the 
 terms and conditions of the contract and give them a chance to cancel 
 should they so wish. 
 
 
 
M) Why do the Society 
 require a 'consent to mortgage' form to be signed by anyone over 17 years 
 of age, who will be residing in the mortgaged property but not party to 
 the mortgage? 
 
Under common law, any occupant over 17 years of age has 
 rights to remain resident should for any reason it became necessary for 
 the property to be vacated. 
 
 As mortgagor, you waive these rights by securing a loan 
 on the said property. However any persons resident at the time of the 
 mortgage inception, who are not party to the said mortgage, still hold 
 these rights. By signing a consent to mortgage form they are waiving this 
 right, should for any reason the Society need to take the property into 
 possession. 
 
N) What is Daily 
 Interest? 
 
Interest is calculated on the balance of the account at 
 the end of each day. Interest is then accrued daily and added to the account 
 balance on the last day of every month. This means every cleared payment 
 that is made reduces the mortgage balance and interest is recalculated 
 on the reduced balance. 
 
If you are thinking about taking a mortgage with the Newcastle 
 and want to find out more about daily interest and how much you could 
 save by taking a mortgage that is calculated on daily interest rather 
 than annual interest click here.

O) What is a Guarantor 
 Mortgage? 
 
The Guarantor Mortgage is a simple solution designed to 
 cater for young professionals who would like to take out a mortgage on 
 a property, which, because of its value and mortgage repayments they are 
 unable to cover, based on their own income and/or assets.
 
The Guarantor Mortgage allows a close relative of the borrowing 
 applicant, usually a parent, to provide assistance to the borrower by 
 providing a guarantee for the shortfall, or proportion of the loan which 
 cannot be adequately covered by the borrower's earnings. Click 
 here for further details.
