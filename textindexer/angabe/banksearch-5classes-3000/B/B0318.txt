 Proving increasingly popular, base 
 rate tracker mortgages, do just as the name suggests. Unlike ordinary 
 standard variable rate mortgage, these mortgages literally 'track' 
 the Bank of England base rate. This way, any cuts are automatically 
 passed onto you. In addition, the difference between base and pay 
 rates remains constant for a set period.
