Carbon 
 Neutral®
 
For 
 the first five years of each "Green" 
 mortgage , 
 eight trees will be planted each year. This 
 could make the home "carbon neutral®". 
 "Carbon neutral®" happens when 
 the estimated emissions of CO2 from the home 
 are offset by the estimated absorption rate 
 of CO2 by the new trees. 
 
We 
 work with Future Forests Limited. Future Forests 
 was set up in 1989, to help offset the damage 
 done to the environment by businesses and 
 individuals. Future Forests and its planting 
 partners, plant and maintain new forests or 
 add to existing forests, arrange to measure 
 carbon uptake, and develop carbon management 
 programmes. Norwich and Peterborough forests 
 will be created in East Anglia and Lincolnshire 
 as a result of customers taking out our "Green" 
 mortgages.

Trees 
 will not be planted if you take out a 
 Green Further Advance.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All 
 emission estimates are provided by the 
 Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management 
 and are based on 'best evidence'. The 
 actual amount of carbon taken up by individual 
 trees varies considerably depending on 
 the site, species and management. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Customers 
 may request that a tree be planted in another 
 area of the UK.
 
 
 
 
 
 An 
 early repayment charge equivalent to 3 months' 
 interest will be made if the loan is repaid 
 during the first 4 years. The early repayment 
 charge will be calculated using the interest 
 rate which applies when the loan is repaid.
