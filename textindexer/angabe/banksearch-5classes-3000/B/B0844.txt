 The Portfolio Bond is a lump sum investment bond with no fixed 
 term. It is designed to be a long-term investment and should not be viewed 
 as a short-term commitment. The minimum investment is £5,000. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A limited administration charge will apply in the first five 
 years from the start date. An annual management charge of between 1.00% 
 and 1.50% will be applied each year on all investment-linked funds and is 
 taken daily, except for the With-Profit and With-Profit Income Funds where 
 Norwich Union's expenses are taken into account when they calculate the 
 bonus rate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The value of an investment can go down as well as up and 
 is not guaranteed. Please note that these special terms may be withdrawn 
 or varied at Norwich Union's discretion at any time. Any financial advice 
 given will relate only to the products of Norwich Union. Full written details 
 available on request.
