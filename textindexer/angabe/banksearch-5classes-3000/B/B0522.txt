Cumberland
 Estate Agents Ltd
 
Established
 in 1992, Cumberland Estate Agents is a wholly
 owned subsidiary of Cumberland Building
 Society. The estate agency offers a full
 residential estate agency service with over 10
 branches in Cumbria.
 
Cumberland
 Building Society
 
Established
 in 1850, the Cumberland is a strong regional
 building society with over 30 branches mainly
 in Cumbria and Dumfriesshire, but extending
 to Preston in North Lancashire and Haltwhistle
 in West Northumberland. The Society has
 in excess of 180,000 investors and 21,000
 borrowers. The Directors and Management
 of the Society are committed to the Cumberland
 remaining an independent mutual building
 society run for the benefit of its savers
 and borrowers. At the Society's 1999 Annual
 General Meeting members voted overwhelmingly
 (94%) for a change in the rules on voting.
 This means if at some time in the future
 a resolution supporting a conversion to
 a bank, or a takeover
 or merger is put forward, it would need
 a 75% majority. At the Society's 2000 and
 2001 Annual General Meetings, members voted
 overwhelmingly (98%) in favour of re-electing
 existing Directors. With the backing of
 members and no outside shareholders looking
 for a share of profits, the Cumberland can
 continue to operate as a successful, independent
 regional building society and demonstrate
 the tangible benefits of mutuality through
 the savings and mortgage products it offers
 through its branches.
