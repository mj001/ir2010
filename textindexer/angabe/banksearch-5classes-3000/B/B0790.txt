 lender may be able to take advantage of free Mortgage Payment Protection
 insurance for the first 6 months. Full Details can be found in our

Insurance
 
The
 Cumberland requires every mortgaged property to be insured. Most
 customers choose to arrange this insurance through the Society under
 a block policy, with the premium automatically being charged to
 their mortgage account. If you choose not to arrange your insurance,
 through the Society or you cancel the insurance we have arranged
 for you at any time, a one of administration fee (currently £25)
 will be payable.
