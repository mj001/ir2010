	 	INTEREST
	*Interest will be paid or credited after deduction of income tax at the lower rate of 20% or, subject to the required certification, gross.
**AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if interest was paid and added each year. (As every advertisement for a savings product which quotes an interest rate will contain an AER, you will be able to compare more easily what return you can expect from your savings over time.) If you do make a withdrawal from this account without giving 7 days’ notice, you will lose 7 days’ gross interest on the amount of the withdrawal. If you place notice 7 or more times on your account during the financial year, the interest rate will be reduced by 1.50% gross for the 7 day period. This means that the stated rate of interest will not be achieved. Please note that, if monthly interest is not added to your account, then the AER will not be achieved.
 	
	 	GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
	These terms and conditions (and those contained in the Scarborough Building Society General Investment Conditions) together with the Scarborough Building Society Memorandum and Rules set out the contractual relationship between Scarborough Building Society ('the Society'), and you, the member.
These conditions contain important information and should be read by you before you open an account with the Society. These conditions are available on this site by clicking on Other Information. 
 	
	 	OPENING AN ACCOUNT
	The minimum investment required to open a Scarborough 7 By Post Account is £1,000.
The maximum amount which may be invested in a Scarborough 7 By Post Account upon opening and during the life of the account is £250,000. This includes any interest which is credited to the account.
The Society reserves the right to close your Scarborough 7 By Post Account if the balance falls below £1,000.
The initial payment and any subsequent payments to your Scarborough 7 By Post Account will only be accepted in the form of a cheque or transfer from an existing Society investment account.
This is a share account and on opening the account, the account holder(s) will become an investing member(s) of the Society, in accordance with its Rules.
 	
	 	PROOF OF IDENTITY
	Proof of identity and verification of address are required for all applicants. Two original documents, not more than three months old are required for each investor, photocopies are not acceptable. The documents will be returned to you and should be either:
- Utility bill (e.g. Gas/Electricity)
- Bank/Building Society Statement
- Current Council Tax/Notice of Tax Coding
and MUST show the name and address of the investor as it appears on the application form. Further verification checks may be carried out by the Society.
If you already have an account with the Society bearing your current address, identification is not required.
Unless proof of identity is provided, and all appropriate sections of the application form have been completed, including date of birth, we will return your investment to you.
 	
	 	INTEREST
	If the balance of your Scarborough 7 By Post Account exceeds £1,000, interest may, on your written instructions be paid monthly/annually either to a designated bank or building society account, or added to the balance of your Scarborough 7 By Post Account. If the balance of your Scarborough 7 By Post Account falls below £1,000, or you do not request to have your interest paid monthly, interest will be paid annually on 1 May. The Society reserves the right to change the date on which interest is credited to your account.
Interest which is payable monthly will be credited to your Scarborough 7 By Post Account or your designated bank or building society account on the first working day of each calendar month.
If the balance of your Scarborough 7 By Post Account falls below £1,000, the interest rate payable for the period that the balance remains below £1,000 will be the Society's variable base savings rate applicable at the time. Details are available on request.
All rates are variable, and the gross monthly rates do not normally compound to the full annual rates shown.
 	
	 	GIVING NOTICE
	7 Days’ notice must be given to withdraw/transfer funds from or close your Scarborough 7 By Post Account. Notice can be given by telephone or in writing. The Society will confirm the amount which you have placed on notice and the date on which the funds will be withdrawn/transferred from your account, or your account closed. Any request to cancel or reduce the amount on notice must be received by the Society at least two full working days before the confirmed transaction date. This request can be given by telephone or in writing. All notice requests will be treated as withdrawal requests unless otherwise stated.
If the Telephone Access conditions do not apply to you, any telephone instructions must be confirmed by you in writing to the Society.
If you deposit further investments in your Scarborough 7 By Post Account, after placing your account on notice to close, withdraw from or transfer your account, then a separate notice instruction must be received by the Society before access to the further investments will be allowed.
Withdrawals/transfers to other Society accounts or closure of your account are permitted without giving 7 days’ notice. However, a charge of 7 days’ gross interest will be applied to the amount withdrawn/transferred or the balance, if closed. If you place notice 7 or more times on your account during the financial year, the interest rate will be reduced by 1.50% gross for the 7 day period.
 	
	 	WITHDRAWALS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS
	Your Scarborough 7 By Post Account cannot be operated through any of the Society's branches.
Up to six notices of withdrawals/transfers/closure are allowed in each financial year without any charge. Where subsequent notice is given to either withdraw/transfer or close your Scarborough 7 By Post Account, the Society will charge for this facility by reducing the interest rate applicable to your Scarborough 7 By Post Account by 1.50% gross for the 7 day period, either in relation to the amount which is being withdrawn/transferred or the balance of the account if notice has been given to close your account. Once notice has been given and this amount deducted, should you change your mind and cancel the notice, or let it expire, the amount will not be refunded to your account.
The Society may, from time to time, vary the interest rate reduction charge applicable to your Scarborough 7 By Post Account, in accordance with its General Investment Conditions. You are advised to request details of the amount of the reduction in interest before giving notice on your Scarborough 7 By Post Account.
This account does not offer cheque withdrawals payable to a third party. All cheques will be made payable to one or all of the account holders and sent to the last address on record.
Within 24 hours of receipt of instructions, the Society, wherever possible, will process all cheque withdrawals and transfers to other accounts subject to account terms and conditions.
