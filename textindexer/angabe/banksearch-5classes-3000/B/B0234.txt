	Fund Objective 
	
	
	
	
- The fund aims to achieve long-term capital growth from a portfolio made up of shares of US companies.
	
	 
	 
	
	Investment Policy 
	
	
	
	
- The portfolio is broadly invested, comprising over 300 companies to reflect the broad range of US investment opportunities. Companies of all sizes will be found in the portfolio, chosen on their individual merits.
	
	
- The manager is prepared to invest a relatively large proportion of portfolio in a single industry sector but this is based purely on the availability of companies within that sector believed to represent exciting investment opportunities rather than a view on the outlook for the sector itself.

Please note past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance, the value of
units can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed. No product charges have been taken into account
except the fund management charge. Since July 1997 pension funds have been unable to recover tax deducted at source on dividends from UK equities.
Please note funds not designated in sterling may rise and fall simply as a result of exchange rate
fluctuations.
