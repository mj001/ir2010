Savings
 and Investment Choices from the Cumberland
 
The
 Cumberland offers a range of variable and fixed interest rate building
 society savings and investment accounts and a full current
 account service.
 
Important
 Note
 As
 we do not offer a full postal investment service, we
 do not accept new accounts from new customers who live
 outside our branch operating area. Some restrictions
 may also apply to new accounts available to existing
 customers who live outside our branch operating area.
 Existing customers should telephone 01228 403144 for
 further information. 
 
 
 New Investors
 The
 Society requires new investors to agree to assign, for
 an indefinite period, any possible windfall rights,
 in the unlikely event of conversion to a bank or a takeover,
 to a charitable foundation.
