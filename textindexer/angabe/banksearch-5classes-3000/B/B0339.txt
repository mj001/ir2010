 IMPORTANT
 POINTS TO NOTE IN RELATION TO REPAYMENT OF FIXED RATE MORTGAGE
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interest 
 charged up to end of month in which loan repaid. Early Repayment 
 Charge payable if loan repaid in full or in part within the 5 
 years Early Repayment Charge period. If you decide to repay 
 your loan in full or in part within the Early Repayment Charge 
 period of your loan, or the Society takes possession of your property 
 and sells it within this period, additional interest will be payable. 
 The amount to be repaid is called an Early Repayment Charge. This 
 will be calculated on the original loan amount if the loan is 
 being repaid in full or the amount being repaid if only part of 
 the loan is being repaid. The amount repayable will be 5% from 
 the date of completion up to 1 year, 4.75% from 1 year 1 day up 
 to 2 years, 4.5% from 2 years 1 day up to 3 years and 4% from 
 3 years 1 day up to 5 years. If for example you made i) an early 
 repayment of £10,000 in year 1, the maximum Early Repayment Charge 
 would be £500 ii) an early repayment of £45,000 in year 1, the 
 maximum Early Repayment Charge would be £2,250. In addition if 
 you repay your loan in full within the first 12 months 
 from the date of completion of your loan the Society will charge 
 an amount equal to 1.75% of the original loan amount. 
 
If you 
 repay your loan in part within the first 12 months from 
 the date of completion of your loan, the Society will charge an 
 amount equal to 1.75% of the amount you repay. This is payable 
 in addition to the Early Repayment Charge. If for example you 
 made an early repayment of £10,000 within the first twelve months 
 the extra charge would be £175. The Early Repayment Charge will 
 not be payable if you are moving home and simultaneously taking 
 out a new loan, at the Society's base variable mortgage rate, 
 without the benefit of a fixed rate or other incentive. The amount 
 of the new loan must be for at least 90% of the existing fixed 
 rate loan amount which is not repaid (in full or in part) during 
 the remainder of the 5 years from the date of completion 
 of the loan on which the fixed rate was given. If however any 
 new loan is for less than 90% of your existing fixed rate loan 
 amount, an Early Repayment Charge will be payable on the difference 
 between the existing fixed rate loan amount and the amount of 
 the new loan e.g. existing loan £30,000, new loan £25,000, Early 
 Repayment Charge payable on £5,000.
 
IMPORTANT 
 CUSTOMER INFORMATION - TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT 
 
The availability 
 of this fixed rate is limited and we may withdraw or change the 
 terms of the product (or both) at any time before we have received 
 your completed mortgage application form and the arrangement fee 
 of £290. Rates on future fixed rate products may be higher or 
 lower than this particular fixed rate. Completion of a mortgage 
 application form and payment of the arrangement fee guarantees 
 the availability of the funds you require at this particular fixed 
 rate for two months from the day we receive your completed mortgage 
 application form and the arrangement fee. Your mortgage must then 
 be completed within three months of the Society's Offer of Loan. 
 The arrangement fee is not refundable under any circumstances, 
 unless your mortgage application is declined before a mortgage 
 valuation is carried out because it does not meet the Society's 
 lending criteria. The arrangement fee is not transferable to any 
 other product. 
 
 
 
 
 
Typical example: 
 The example assumes a capital and interest mortgage of £45,000 over 25 
 years. The property costs £60,000. This example also assumes that the 
 interest rate of 5.47% will apply until the end of the fixed rate period 
 i.e. 1/8/2007. From 2/8/2007 interest will be charged at the Society's 
 base variable mortgage rate. Typical APR 5.6% variable. 
 The APR and interest rate quoted will change from time to time after the 
 end of the fixed rate period. The monthly mortgage payment would be £275.53 
 until 1/8/2007 and £270.32 from 2/8/2007 for the remainder of the term 
 of the loan. Other payments that are required at the start of the loan 
 include an arrangement fee of £290, a valuation fee of £170 (this includes 
 an administration fee of £50), an insurance contingency fee of £25, legal 
 fees of £117.50 and a first capital and interest repayment of £8.89 if 
 the loan begins on 31/7/2002. When the loan is paid off there is a redemption 
 charge of £50 and a deeds production fee of £35. This means that the total 
 amount payable on the loan is £82,104.99. On repayment of your loan, 
 interest will be charged up to the end of the month in which it is repaid.
