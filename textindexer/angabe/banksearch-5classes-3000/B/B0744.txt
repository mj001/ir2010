Growth And Modernisation Continues Apace At Cheshire Building Society
Cheshire Building Society today announces its financial results for 2001, which
demonstrate an impressive and consistent performance for the North West-based mutual
building society.
Record lending of £535m has continued to drive high growth in assets, coupled with
independent recognition as a provider of the lowest cost building society mortgage
over three years in the Moneyfacts survey of the top 35 lenders.*
Pre tax profit for the year was up 15.9% to £15.3m aided by a 29.6% rise in non-interest
income to £14.9m.
Other financial highlights for the year include:
- 
Total assets grew by £323m to £2,928m, an increase of 12.4%.
- 
Share balances were up by £294m, or (17.4%), to £1,986m, our highest ever increase.
- 
Capital increased by 7.1% to £178.1m.
- 
The quality of our lending improved with a 25% reduction in mortgage arrears.
The Cheshire is the 11th largest society in the UK and the largest based in the
North West of England. In addition to the strong financial results the Society achieved
a number of other successes during 2001 including:
- 
All existing borrowers now benefit from daily interest following the introduction
of a new computer system.
- 
Assistance to around 100 charitable projects, which helped to raise almost
a quarter of a million pounds.
- 
Launch of a partnership with children’s charity NCH.
- 
Further improvements in members’ access to services through its Contact Centre
and interactive website at www.thecheshire.co.uk.
- 
Launch of four affinity savings accounts, three of which support local football
clubs to help fund the development of young players.
In 2001 there was a continued substantial investment in the Society’s infrastructure,
technology, systems and people as part of its evolution into a modern, forward looking
organisation, which resulted in an overall increase in administrative expenses of
17.8%. We anticipate the programme will result in efficiency gains and that we will
continue to realise real benefits and value for customers as well as an improved cost
structure for the business.
Customer loyalty continued to pay dividends for Cheshire members during 2001. 
With no shareholders to pay, members benefited from consistently competitive interest
rates and terms. An additional £120m of mortgages qualified for the Society’s Mortgage
Loyalty Scheme during the year, which gives borrowers over five years a discount on
their rate of 0.5%.
Savers were also rewarded through the Members’ Loyalty Bond, which guarantees a
rate of 0.75% below the Society’s mortgage rate. These initiatives contributed to
a ‘mutuality dividend’ that is estimated to have benefited members to the tune of
£25m over the past three years. 
Commenting on these results, Colin Whittle, Chief Executive, said:
"We have upheld our principles and have continued to provide real value for our
members in achieving our excellent business results. For example we have delivered
on our commitment to introduce daily interest charging for all our borrowers. This
is not only a fairer system, it also gives our members the opportunity to make significant
savings over the life of their mortgage.
Our loyalty schemes have the approval of our members and we will be looking to
see what further improvements we can make in 2002. Our support for our communities
continues and we have strengthened our commitment with a 50% increase in funds available.
 We also recognise that our obligations are not limited solely to support for local
charities and have implemented a new strategy to ensure that we are making a real
difference across all areas of social responsibility.
New investment initiatives throughout the organisation are focused on providing
personalised world class service to our members, which is our single biggest priority.
 Allied to our financial strength and the benefits that our mutuality has consistently
delivered, I am confident we will continue to improve the value that members receive
from their Society.”

Mutuality means that members, rather than external shareholders, own the Society.
The Cheshire’s aim is to use its mutual status to provide the best possible products
and levels of service that it can for members. This is what is meant by ‘delivering
mutuality’.
- 
* In December 2001 a MoneyFacts survey of the top 35 lenders for interest paid
on a £50,000 mortgage over the last three years found that Cheshire Building Society
members with a Loyalty Mortgage paid over £1,000 less than the survey’s most expensive
lender.
- 
Support for local communities is an important part of mutuality. Over the
last 5 years the Society has helped voluntary organisations to raise over one million
pounds for various causes. The Society also continued its support of the production
of Granada Action. This community based television programme gives many local charities
the chance to promote their activities within the region to a wide audience.
- 
Cheshire Building Society is one of the UK’s top regional building societies
with assets in excess of £2.9bn. It is based in Macclesfield, has 51 branches throughout
the North West of England and serves members nation-wide. The Society subscribes to
both the mortgage and banking codes and is committed to mutuality as being in the
best interests of its members.
