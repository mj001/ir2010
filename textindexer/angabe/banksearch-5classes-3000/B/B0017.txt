Local Knowledge and
Reputation
Established in 1849,
the Society has helped thousands of people to buy their own homes. As a smaller
Society the Ipswich is able to offer a friendly flexible mortgage service. With
our heritage in Suffolk we have a unique knowledge of the East Anglian region
and can therefore make well informed decisions which may assist when assessing
applications of an unusual nature.
Talk to us soon
The Society has 17 offices throughout the county of Suffolk. It is useful if you
can call us to make an interview appointment. At our branch locations you may
call in at any time during office hours and ask to see one of our mortgage
specialists. Alternatively if it is more convenient for you, we can arrange to
visit you at your home.
We recommend that you contact the Ipswich as soon as you are thinking of buying
a new home (even before you go house hunting). We can then ascertain how much
you might borrow.
First Class
Service
Our staff will be able to tell you whether we can offer you a mortgage. Subject
to satisfactory references and property valuation a formal Offer of Advance
would be issued to you and your solicitor.
Local Homes Price
Survey
Recently released figures on property price changes throughout
the country show that East Anglia is heading the field with the highest increase
in values (comparing the first quarter of 2002 against the same period
2001), with an average increase across the county of 20%.

and East Anglian Daily Times.
