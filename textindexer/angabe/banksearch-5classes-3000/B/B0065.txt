At
 Kensington we embrace change, supporting those whose work or home
 life has taken a different direction. We look at each case
 individually, basing our judgment on the ability to make repayments,
 not catch-all criteria.
 
 
 Our
 understanding of people&#146;s unique needs is an approach which has
 helped us grow dramatically. That&#146;s
 why, in just six years, our policy of
 continuous innovation has financed over 35,000 non-standard
 mortgages with a value exceeding £2.5 billion.
