 PORTMAN MEMBERS RECEIVE £30M FROM THE BENEFITS OF MUTUALITY 
 
 
 
Portman, the UK's fourth largest building society, reports results for 2000 
which show the tangible benefits of mutuality for members.
HIGHLIGHTS
 
- 
 
£30m returned to members, showing the benefits of remaining a 
 mutual.
 
 
- 
 
A reduction in net interest margin from 1.45% to 1.28%, 
 reflecting the competitiveness of our products.
 
 
- 
 
Total assets up by 8% to £6.9 billion.
 
 
- 
 
Net retail receipts of £709m - twice natural market share.
 
 
- 
 
£1.25 billion in new residential mortgage advances.
 
 
- 
 
Costs efficiently contained with no increase year on year. 
 Management
 expenses ratio down from 0.94% to 0.85%. 
 
 
A modest increase in pre-tax profits demonstrating the 
 Society's commitment to earning profit only to sustain future growth.
 
Commenting on the Society's performance, Robert Sharpe, Chief Executive, says, 
 "This has been another year when members of the Society have seen tangible 
 benefits from Portman remaining a mutual.
 
"In spite of the competitive market, Portman has continued to grow by 
 providing customers with consistent and attractive product pricing delivered 
 primarily through an extensive branch network. Our performance in the savings 
 market has been nothing short of spectacular", he added.
 
"Not only have Portman members benefited from excellent products and services, 
 we have also made considerable progress in member participation and 
 communication. For example over the last year we have:
 
- 
 
undertaken extensive customer contact and research prior to 
 investing in new activities such as mobile branches to serve smaller 
 communities, the first of which should be rolled out this year.
 
 
- 
 
decided to provide every member with a booklet giving a 
 comprehensive report on the Society's activities and performance during the 
 year. We will also ask members whether they wish to continue having more 
 information in this form.
 
 
- 
 
embraced openness and transparency by including details of 
 Directors' salaries/fees and bonuses in the forthcoming AGM booklet.
 
 
- 
 
confirmed the continuing use of secure voting facilities in 
 our branches. This has already helped increase, five-fold, the number of 
 members voting at the AGM over the last three years.
 
 
- 
 
responded positively to a request by members asking that from 
 this year's AGM we announce the number of discretionary proxy votes entrusted 
 to the Chairman.
 
 
- 
 
asked members to choose the venue for the 2001 AGM - 
 Bournemouth or London. Over 80% of those who responded requested Bournemouth.
 
"We will continue to involve our members before deciding on new business 
 initiatives. We believe this is important and during 2001 we plan to set up 
 member contact groups to help this process.
 
"At the end of December, a member, who had advertised and co-ordinated support 
 through a website, delivered six resolutions to the Society's Head Office. 
 None of the resolutions requested the Society to convert to a PLC. After 
 careful analysis and checking, verified by legal advisors and independent 
 scrutineers, it was confirmed that the resolutions did not have the necessary 
 support. Therefore we will not put these to the 2001 AGM", Robert Sharpe 
 concluded.
