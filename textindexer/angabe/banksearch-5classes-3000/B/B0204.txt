 INDIVIDUAL SAVINGS
 ACCOUNTS (ISA)
 
-EXPLANATORY
 NOTES-
 
The new tax free ISA was available from 6th April 1999.
 There are no new PEPS and TESSA's from 6th April 1999. ISA's give anyone over
 16 years a new opportunity to protect their savings from tax.
 
The Holmesdale is offering both a "Mini Cash ISA" and a
 "Tessa ISA". The Society is not offering a Maxi ISA, which includes Insurance
 and Stocks and Shares. The Mini
 Cash ISA is available to existing members or Surrey residents only. The Tessa ISA is
 available to existing Holmesdale Tessa Account Holders.

How
 much can I save?
 
There is an annual allowance on the Mini Cash ISA of £3,000 up to
 the year ended 5th April 2006.
 
You may only subscribe to one mini cash ISA a year, but you can
 subscribe up to £3,000 in a mini stocks and shares ISA and £1,000 in a mini insurance
 ISA with another provider. By subscribing to this ISA, you may not subscribe to a maxi ISA
 in the same year. (A maxi ISA includes a stocks and shares component and may also include
 cash and insurance components. There is a maximum overall subscription limit of £7,000 in
 a maxi ISA in the years ending 5th April 2000/2006). However, you can also subscribe up to
 the amount deposited in a matured TESSA in a mini cash ISA or a TESSA-only ISA without it
 counting towards the annual ISA subscription limits. You have up to 6 months from the date
 the TESSA matures to do so.
 
With the TESSA ISA you will be able to reinvest the whole capital
 sum (but not the interest) on top of your annual ISA allowance. The interest could
 however, be used for a Mini Cash ISA if your limit has not been exceeded. A Tessa maturity
 certificate must be available at the time the account is opened. Subscriptions to a
 TESSA-Only ISA do not count towards the ISA annual subscription limits. You may have a
 TESSA-Only ISA with the Society even if you already, or might wish to subscribe to a Mini
 or Maxi ISA with another provider.

Can I add to a TESSA ISA?
 
You can only add to a Tessa ISA up to the amount of capital in your
 matured Tessa. However, once a Mini Cash ISA is opened you can add the capital of a
 matured Tessa.

What
 about tax?
 
Everything you earn in an ISA is completely free of UK Income Tax
 and Capital Gains Tax. Also, you do not lose any tax exemption if you make withdrawals of
 capital, as you do with a Tessa.

Can I have a joint account?
 
Only accounts in your sole name are allowed.

Do you have to buy from the same provider each year?
 
You do not have to.

Do you have to keep
 your ISA for a set period of time?
 
No, they are not term investments and there is no minimum or maximum
 qualifying period.

 top of the page.
 
Can I get my money out easily if I need to?
 
Yes, you will be able to take money from an ISA at any time without
 losing any tax relief. However, the ISA does need 60 days written notice of withdrawal or
 60 days loss of interest on the amount withdrawn.

 top of the page.
 
If I take money out, can I put it back in again?
 
Not in the same tax year, because the allowance applies to the sum
 total of your deposits. For example, you invest £2900 into a Mini Cash ISA when your
 allowance is £3000 you then take out £300. You could not put back that £300, but you
 would be able to put in a further £100 to bring the total deposited in one tax year up to
 £3000.
 
If the account falls below £500 it will be closed.

How long can you go on saving in ISA's?
 
The Government has guaranteed that they will run for at least 10
 years.

What
 are CAT Standards?
 
These are voluntary standards on fair CHARGES, easy ACCESS and
 decent TERMS.
 
These are:-
 
Charges: No Charges
 
Access: Minimum transaction size
 no greater than £10. Withdrawals with 7 working days or less.
 
Terms: Interest rate no lower
 than 2% below base rate.
 
Rate increase within one month of base rate increase.
 
No special conditions e.g. limit on number of withdrawals.
 
As our minimum investment will be £500, we shall be prevented from
 offering CAT standards, but we will be offering competitive products.

Who can subscribe to an ISA?
 
Anyone who is 16 years or over.
 
You must not have subscribed to another ISA of the same components
 type in the same tax year.
 
Anyone who is resident or ordinarily resident in the UK.
 
Withdrawals at sixty days written notice with full interest or on
 demand with 60 days loss of interest on the amount withdrawn.

Charges Access and Terms (C.A.T.)

 required and the withdrawal terms (see interest rate leaflet).
