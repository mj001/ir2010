Typical example: Based on an interest rate of 3.19% (APR 5.7%), a 0.75% 
discount, a 0.50% discount and the Society's Standard Variable Rate, a property with 
a value of £85,000 with a repayment mortgage of £50,000 will require 12 monthly 
payments of £244.38; 12 at £293.86; 12 at £301.29 and 264 at £316.41. The total 
amount payable over 25 years (300 payments) is £93,809.35. This example is 
based on known information, and on the Society's Standard Variable Rate, 
taking into account the 3 year discount period, the refund of the valuation fee, 
£25.00 funds release fee and an estimated amount of £117.50 for legal costs; no 
account has been taken of any variation to the interest rate, nor of premiums on any 
policy(ies) which may be taken out in conjunction with the loan. Written 
quotations available on request.
