Mortgages are available to persons aged 18 or over, secured on freehold or leasehold properties in Wales and England and are subject to status. Security will be required. All lending will be subject to appraisal of the financial standing of the applicants. Written quotations are available from this office on request.
Principality Building Society is regulated by the Financial Services Authority. We arrange life assurance, pensions and investments only with the Norwich Union Marketing Group, members of which are regulated by the Financial Services Authority.
The examples shown assume no variation in the Society's standard rate of interest or in the annual buildings and contents insurance premiums. The APRs quoted are for mortgages on an interest only basis, for which an appropriate pension plan, endowment policy or other suitable means of repaying the capital sum at the end of the term should be arranged.
Fixed Rate Mortgage - Option 1
For borrowers purchasing a house for £50,000 and applying for an interest only mortgage of £34,000 over 25 years to be secured on the property.
The fixed rate of interest until 31st July 2005 is 4.99% APR 5.8%. The interest rate will revert to our standard variable rate on 1st August 2005. The total amount payable would be £81,428.83 (including the capital sum which would need to be repaid, together with Maxicover buildings and contents insurance costs, as well as estimated fees and charges of £690.35). Assuming completion of the loan on 1st July 2002 there would be 36 monthly payments of £141.38 followed by 264 payments of £157.25 (assuming that at the end of the fixed rate period the standard variable rate throughout the remainder of the mortgage term will be 5.55%). The APR is variable.
