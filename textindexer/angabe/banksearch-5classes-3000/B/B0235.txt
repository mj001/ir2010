Valuation fees
	
When assessing any mortgage application, we need expert opinion on the condition 
	and value of the property in question. To get that, we instruct a valuer to visit the property and produce 
	a written report. The cost of this is paid by you.
	The cost of a mortgage valuation is worked out using a sliding scale which is shown in the table below. 
	The table also shows the cost of the more detailed Home Buyer Survey and Valuation. The cost of a full 
	Building Survey (which is also known as a structural survey) would be set by the surveyor who undertakes 
	it for you, should you decide to commission one.

The fees shown include VAT and a £55 administration charge. If a re-inspection is 
	required, an additional fee of £40 will be charged for each re-inspection.
	
Which inspection is right for me?
	
The mortgage valuation
	
The mortgage valuation is solely for our purposes so that we can be satisfied that 
	the property provides sufficient security for us to lend. The mortgage valuation is not a survey and does not give any 
	indication as to whether the property is worth what you are paying for it, nor does it provide a list 
	of any repairs that may be needed.
	
Home Buyer Survey and Valuation
	
We can arrange to carry out the Home Buyer Survey and Valuation (HSBV) for you at 
	the same time as the mortgage valuation. Presented in a standard format, it is designed to focus on 
	defects and problems which are considered urgent or significant. An HSBV is suitable for properties which 
	are of standard type and construction and appear to be in reasonable condition.
	
Building Survey
	
This type of survey is suitable for all types of residential properties and, in particular, for period properties, 
	those with extensive accommodation or those in a particularly poor state of repair although it can be done for any 
	type of residential property. It is tailored to your requirements but will be very detailed, covering 
	all defects whether major or minor. There is no standard or scale fee for a Building Survey but the cost 
	will be significantly higher than for the HSBV. In most cases, the cost does not include a valuation so 
	a mortgage valuation will need to be done as well.

Application fees
	 
With some special mortgage offers, you may have 
 to pay what's known as an application fee, the first part of which 
 is non-refundable should your mortgage not proceed. The main reason 
 for this is that with some special products, we actually "commit" 
 part of our available funds, so that these are not lent to anyone 
 else. If your mortgage does not complete, we suffer a loss. Normally, 
 you will be asked to pay part of the fee when you apply. You can 
 then pay the remainder of the fee when your mortgage funds are 
 released, or it can be collected as part of the monthly mortgage 
 payment following the next annual review of your account.

Mortgage Risk Payment
	 
 Lending a higher proportion of the purchase 
 price of a property brings with it a higher risk to the Society. 
 This is alleviated by a Mortgage Risk Payment which provides us 
 with a form of insurance.
 
 See our Mortgage 
 Risk Payment section for more information.
