Typical example 1: Based on an interest rate of 4.84% (APR 5.9%) and the 
Society's Standard Variable Rate, a property with a value of £85,000 with a repayment 
mortgage of £50,000 will require 24 monthly payments of £290.91 and 276 at 
£316.41. The total amount payable over 25 years (300 payments) is £94,513.75.
Typical example 2: Based on an interest rate of 5.09% (APR 5.9%) and the 
Society's Standard Variable Rate, a property with a value of £60,000 with a repayment 
mortgage of £50,000 will require 24 monthly payments of £298.31 and 276 at 
£316.41. The total amount payable over 25 years (300 payments) is £94,691.35. 
These examples are based on known information, and on the Society's current 
Standard Variable Rate, taking into account the 2 year discount period, the 
refund of the valuation fee, £25.00 funds release fee and an estimated amount of 
£117.50 for legal costs; no account has been taken of any variation to the interest 
rate, nor of premiums on any policy(ies) which may be taken out in conjunction 
with the loan. Written quotations available on request.
