- If your interest is credited to your account, the passbook will be brought up to date when you carry out your next transaction or, if you request it earlier.
	
- 	
	
	
- Income Tax at the rate of 20% on the interest shown above (with the exception of Expatriate Accounts, Charities, and Exempt Pension Funds) is deemed to have been paid by the Society under arrangements with the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, unless valid Inland Revenue form(s) R85 has/have been received from the account holder(s), and registered by the Society, in respect of their share of the interest which is being claimed on a gross basis (ie without tax deducted). 
	
- Individuals who are non-taxpayers, and who have not registered to receive their interest without tax deducted, can claim a repayment of tax from the Inland Revenue. Similarly, individuals with taxable income in the starting rate band of 10%, who are due to pay less tax than the amount deducted from their interest, can also claim a repayment of tax direct from the Inland Revenue.
	
- Please note that in the case of accounts held in more than one name, where all account holders have completed a form R85, interest has been paid without tax deducted. If not all named account holders have registered as non-tax payers, interest has been paid part net/part gross, in proportion to the number of account holders who have provided us with a completed R85 forms.
	
- Any interest shown above, whether or not tax has been deducted, should be included in your annual return of income to the Inland Revenue and this statement may be used for this purpose.
	
- IF YOU HAVE COMPLETED A FORM R85, YOU ARE REMINDED THAT YOU MUST TELL THE SOCIETY IMMEDIATELY IF YOU ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO RECEIVE INTEREST WITH NO TAX DEDUCTED.
	
	
- 
	
	
- Interest on Expatriate Accounts, where valid Inland Revenue form(s) R105 has/have been received from the account holder(s), and registered by the Society, has been paid without deduction of UK tax.
	
- YOU ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE SOCIETY WITHOUT DELAY IF ANY PERSON BENEFICIALLY ENTITLED TO THE INTEREST FROM THIS ACCOUNT BECOMES ORDINARILY RESIDENT IN THE UK.
	
	
- This statement is NOT a statement for the purposes of Section 352 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. If you require a Certificate of Deduction of Tax for that purpose one will be issued on request if you return the slip overleaf.

- With effect from 2nd January 2002, the Paid Up Share Account was renamed Sovereign Shares. Any accounts with guarantees linked to the Paid Up Share rate will now have the guarantee linked to the rate payable for balances of £1 - £499 in the Sovereign Shares. This rate has always been at least the same as or greater than the Paid Up Share rate. Those customers affected will therefore continue to benefit from the guarantees which have applied.

	ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR ISA ACCOUNTS
	
	We guarantee that the rates of interest on this product will never fall more than 1% below the Bank of England base rate (1.25% for the monthly income option) ('the minimum guaranteed rates'). If the minimum guaranteed rates are in force, any new interest rates will become effective 14 days from the day after a subsequent Bank of England base rate change.
	
	The Terms and Conditions of these accounts allow withdrawals on receipt of 30 days written notice. The minimum operating balance of £3,000 still applies, but above this figure withdrawals may be made by cheque for a minimum of £500. Investors should note however, that in accordance with ISA rules, investments in any tax year are limited to the amount permitted by the Inland Revenue (£3,000 in 2001/2002) regardless of the level of withdrawals made.
	
	If you have subscribed to your Skipton Mini Cash ISA in 2000/2001 you may continue to subscribe to the same ISA in 2001/2002. If you did not make a subscription to your Skipton Mini Cash ISA in 2000/2001 a new application form will be required if you would like to subscribe in 2001/2002. An application form can be obtained from your local branch or requested from our Statement Hotline 01756 705035. The tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April. If your passbook is up to date it will clarify what subscriptions you have made to your Skipton Mini Cash ISA, alternatively you may call our Statement Hotline.
