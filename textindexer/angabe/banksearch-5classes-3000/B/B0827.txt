 THE ACCOUNT
 
 The Falcon Flexi-Save account has been designed to allow you to invest monthly. It is a highly flexible account, as you are not restricted to investing the same amount per month. You can change the amount you wish to invest to suit your requirements, as long as it falls between the account’s preset limits. You do not have to make an investment every month either, as the account has no minimum number of investments per year. Again, you choose when and how much you invest, at a time when it suits you. The account’s only restrictions are that you make no more than one payment per calendar month and that you may make no more than two withdrawals per calendar year.
 
 The account attracts one interest rate which is not dependent upon how much you save.
 
 Joint accounts are available.
 
 AVAILABILITY
 
 Please note, this account is available only to those resident in the Society's area of operations. Contact your nearest branch or agency to check on availability.
 
 
 HOW TO OPEN YOUR ACCOUNT
 
 Your Falcon Flexi-Save account can be opened at any Society Branch or Agency. If you are a new investor with the Society you will be asked to provide one form of personal identification and another for address verification. A list of the acceptable items is displayed in all Branches and Agencies and a copy will be made available on request. All requests for identification are standard and conform to regulations which protect you, the Customer, and guard against fraudulent transactions.
 
 
 MINIMUM INITIAL INVESTMENT
 
 The minimum initial investment required to open an account is £20.
 
 
 ADDING TO YOUR INVESTMENT
 
 As the account has been designed to accept regular monthly investments, you are requested to ensure that your monthly payment is no less than £20 and no more than £250 in any one month. However, once you have made your first investment you do not have to pay this amount each month. The maximum £250 investment limit applies to all accounts including those held in joint names. Your investment amount is flexible, as long as it falls between these minimum and maximum amounts. The account is not subject to a minimum number of investments per year either, you make the choice. You can add to your investment either at the counter or you can set up a standing order to suit your requirements.
 
 
 ACCESS TO YOUR INVESTMENT
 
 Your account offers instant access and is not subject to any penalties or charges. You may only make two withdrawals per calendar year. No other withdrawals will be permitted other than to close the account. Withdrawals can be made at any Society Branch or Agency.
 
 
 INTEREST PAYMENTS
 
 The Falcon Flexi-Save account has only one interest rate no matter how much you save, up to the account limit of £50,000.
 
 Interest is paid to the account on the 31st December and can either be credited to your account or transferred to another suitable account with the Society.
 
 
 INCOME TAX
 
 Interest will be paid after deduction of income tax at the lower rate or, subject to the required certification, gross. Registration forms are available from any of the Society’s Branches or Agencies, or direct from the Inland Revenue. If you have Adobe Acrobat Reader click here to download the R85 form. If you are a non-taxpayer you will be able to claim repayment of this tax directly from the Inland Revenue. You can also claim a repayment of tax, if your taxable income falls within the starting rate band and you are eligible to pay less tax than the amount deducted from your interest. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.
 
 The Society is required to supply the Inland Revenue with details of all interest paid or credited to investors each year.
