A 
 GUIDE TO ISAs 
From 6th April 1999 TESSAs 
 and PEPs were replaced by a new tax-free savings scheme called 
 the ISA. The Newcastle Building Society's 'Guide to ISAs' has been compiled 
 especially for the benefit 
 of those people who are eager to learn more about the ISA. It will also 
 be useful for those investors who already have existing tax free savings in 
 the form of a TESSA 
 or PEP and who are keen to know more about ISAs'. 
This Guide has been written 
 in a simple, straightforward manner and addresses the major issues in an easy 
 to read question and answer style. 
Further copies of this Guide 
 are available from any branch of the Newcastle Building Society or through Newcastle 
 Direct by calling 08457 344 345. Alternatively, click

WHAT 
 IS AN ISA? Back to top 
From 6th April 1999 TESSAs 
 and PEPs were replaced by a single tax-efficient savings scheme called the Individual 
 Savings Account or ISA. In contrast to TESSAs and PEPs, you can choose where 
 you save your money. There are three options or components available to you 
 which are:- 
 
- Cash 
 
- Stocks and Shares 
 
 
- Life Insurance 
 
It is up to you whether 
 you want to invest in one component or all three. There are three different 
 types of ISA - Mini ISA, Maxi ISA and a special TESSA Only ISA. 
In order to invest in an 
 ISA you must be a UK resident and at least 16 years of age.

WHY 
 DO WE NEED ISAs? Back to top 
It is the Government who 
 have been responsible for the introduction of ISAs. ISAs have been introduced 
 because of a primary concern that there are around six million people in the 
 UK who do not save money. In addition there is a feeling that in the past the 
 benefits of tax efficient savings have been confined largely to the better-off. 
 As a result of this, proposals for the ISA were announced by the Chancellor 
 in the July budget of 1997. ISAs have been designed with two major objectives 
 in mind: 
- to develop and extend the 
 savings habit 
- to ensure that tax relief 
 on savings is fairly distributed 
 
As with TESSAs and PEPs, 
 any returns on investments placed in an ISA will be completely free of Income 
 and Capital Gains Tax.

WHAT 
 ABOUT TESSA's? Back to top 
 
If you already have a 
 TESSA you will be able to continue making payments into this, subject to the 
 existing annual limits, until it matures. However if you currently do not 
 have a TESSA you will not be able to open one anymore. 
 
If you have a TESSA which 
 is due to mature you will be able to transfer the capital balance of your 
 TESSA account into an ISA following maturity without affecting your annual 
 ISA investment limit or you can transfer into a TESSA Only ISA.

WHAT 
 ABOUT PEPs Back to top 
 
If you currently have 
 a PEP you will be able to keep this and it will continue to be tax free for 
 as long as you hold it. In effect PEPs have become ring-fenced. You will not, 
 however be able to transfer savings from a PEP to an ISA.

WHAT 
 ARE THE BENEFITS OF ISAs? Back to top 
 
- Money invested in an 
 ISA will enjoy the following tax benefits:- 
 - Free from income tax 
 payable on interest earned 
 - Not subject to Capital 
 Gains Tax
 - 10% tax credit 
 on all dividends received until 5th April 2004 
 
- ISAs have been given 
 a guaranteed life of ten years. 
 
- There will be no lock 
 in period. This will allow you access to your money at any time. 
 
- There will be no minimum 
 subscription. This means that you could open an ISA with as little as £10. 
 
 
- ISAs can only be held 
 in individual names. For e.g. husband/wife will each be able to open separate 
 ISA accounts. 
 
- Investors will be able 
 to transfer the capital from a matured TESSA account into an ISA without affecting 
 the ISA subscription limits, thus maximising their tax free savings. 
 
 
- Investors can choose 
 to invest in either cash deposits, stocks and shares and/or life insurance. 
 Furthermore investors can choose whether to invest their money in each of 
 these components with one ISA Manager or with three separate ISA Managers. 
 
 
- Some ISAs will meet CAT 
 standards. This means that investors choosing to invest in one of these ISAs 
 can be sure that charges will be low, they will have easy access to their 
 money and the terms will be easy to understand and fair.

WHAT 
 IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MINI AND MAXI ISAs?
With an ISA you can invest 
 in cash, equities or life insurance, or any combination of the three. There 
 are three types of ISA: Mini ISAs, Maxi ISAs and TESSA-Only ISAs 
The Newcastle Building Society 
 are an approved ISA Manager and we can offer you Mini Cash ISAs and, if you 
 have a maturing TESSA, a TESSA-Only ISA. We can also refer you to Norwich Union 
 who can advise on a range of ISA options including equities ISAs 
A Maxi ISA is managed by 
 one ISA Manager only and enables you to invest the maximum amount allowed each 
 tax year. The investment can be wholly in equities (£7,000 in 2001/2002) 
 or you may include a cash and/or life insurance element. 
Alternatively, you can have 
 one of each of the three Mini ISAs (cash, equities and life insurance), with 
 different ISA Managers for each. You do not have to hold all three elements. 
 You can invest in either Mini ISAs or a Maxi ISA, but you cannot open or invest 
 in both in any one tax year. This means that if you decide to take out, or have 
 already taken out, a Mini Cash ISA this tax year, you cannot take out a Maxi 
 ISA until the next tax year.

WHAT 
 IS A TESSA ONLY ISA? Back to top 
As an alternative to transferring 
 the capital from a matured TESSA into a Maxi ISA or Mini Cash ISA you could 
 choose instead, to transfer this into a special TESSA Only ISA. You will not 
 be permitted to make further contributions to a TESSA Only ISA although your 
 annual investment limit, through a Maxi ISA or Mini Cash ISA, will remain unaffected. 
As with TESSAs and PEPs 
 the Government have limited the amount of money which you can invest in an ISA 
 in any one tax year. 
Each tax year you will be 
 able to invest a maximum of £7,000. Within this overall limit there are 
 also restrictions on the amount you can invest in each component (see table 
 below). 
The table 
 below summarises the annual ISA subscription limits:- 
 
 
 
 
 April 
 2001 to April 2002 
 
 
 Mini 
 ISA's 
 
 
 
 Total 
 Savings Limit 
 £7,000 
 
 
 Cash 
 Up 
 to £3,000 
 
 
 Stocks 
 & Shares 
 Up 
 to £3,000 
 
 
 Life 
 Insurance 
 Up 
 to £1,000 
 
 
 Maxi 
 ISA's 
 
 
 
 Total 
 Savings Limit 
 £7,000 
 
 
 Cash 
 Up 
 to £3,000 
 
 
 Stocks 
 & Shares 
 Up 
 to £7,000 
 
 
 Life 
 Insurance 
 Up 
 to £1,000 
 
 
In addition to the limits 
 detailed in the table above investors will be allowed to invest the capital 
 element (i.e. excluding interest), from a matured TESSA (or a portion of this) 
 into a Maxi ISA, Mini ISA or TESSA Only ISA without affecting the overall limits. 
Withdrawals from an ISA 
 have no effect on these subscription limits. In addition it is worth noting 
 that funds may not be transferred from one ISA component to another.

WHAT ARE 
 THE CAT STANDARDS? Back to top 
In launching the ISA the 
 Government particularly want to help people who are not currently saving to 
 get started and people who are saving to save more. Since many ordinary savers 
 are concerned about getting a poor deal and being caught out by complicated 
 small print, the Government have decided to introduce the idea of CAT standards 
 for ISAs. 
The CAT standards will concentrate 
 on three features:- 
- fair Charges 
- easy Access 
- decent Terms 
 
The introduction of CAT 
 standards will ensure that if an ISA meets the CAT standards the charges will 
 be low, you will have easy access to your money and the terms will be easy 
 to understand and fair. 
 
It should be remembered, 
 however, that there is no obligation for every ISA to meet these standards. 
 Indeed an ISA meeting the CAT standards may not necessarily be the best option 
 for you. For example, you might find that a Mini Cash ISA which does not meet 
 the CAT standards because it restricts the number of withdrawals you can make, 
 offers a better rate of return.

PEPs were replaced by 
 Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) on 6 April 1999. All PEPs held at that 
 date may continue to be held as PEPs outside the ISA, with the same tax treatments 
 as the ISA. The value of any PEP holding will not effect the amount that may 
 be subscribed to an ISA. You can invest up to £7,000 in an ISA per year. 
 The value of current tax relief depends upon individual circumstances. The 
 value of your investment can go down as well as up, so you might not get back 
 the amount invested.
