Eric 
 Davey, Chairman, commented:
 
"These 
 results show that mutuality works for Newcastle Building Society and our 
 members. These record achievements highlight the fact that the Newcastle 
 can beat the PLC banks on performance. We have benefited members on rates 
 and service, invested in staff development, embraced the latest technology, 
 contributed to the community and also returned the right level of profit. 
 We have a sustainable, efficient business." 
 
Robert 
 Hollinshead, Chief Executive, commented:
 
"Because 
 we do not have external shareholders, it is Newcastle&#146;s members who 
 benefit from our success. We are determined to do even more for our members 
 which is why we are harnessing new technology to offer our members new 
 ways of accessing our services, in addition to our branch network. We 
 are in excellent shape to face the market&#146;s challenges."

Financial 
 Performance
 
Newcastle 
 Building Society is run for its members and enters the new millennium 
 in excellent shape. As the financial services industry continues to change, 
 it has seized new opportunities and sought new ways of serving members. 
 Combining new technology with traditional values, the Newcastle achieved 
 a string of record successes in 1999. 
 
Attractively 
 priced products and an ability to take advantage of new technologies such 
 as the Internet contributed to a 9% rise in profit after tax to the record 
 level of £10.3m. 
 
The 
 Newcastle&#146;s mortgage and savings accounts have had an almost constant 
 presence in "best buy" tables over the year. As a result, lending was 
 a record £388m, up 12% on the previous year, and retail investments 
 were a record £122m, up 67% on the previous year. The record growth 
 in assets, 11% to £2.15bn, resulted from competitive rates, especially 
 in fixed rate mortgages.
 
Competitive 
 Advantage through Mutuality
 
The 
 Newcastle&#146;s excellent performance shows that people are better off 
 with a mutual building society. As profits benefit members, rather than 
 external shareholders, the Society is able to operate successfully in 
 the intensely competitive and changing world of personal finance.
 
As 
 a mutual the Newcastle operates a policy of profit sufficiency. This means 
 keeping its net interest margin, the difference between the rate charged 
 to borrowers and the rate paid to savers, as low as possible while generating 
 sufficient profits to provide adequate reserves. This policy allows the 
 Society to focus on providing competitive rates and high standards of 
 customer service, often offering services that are not necessarily profitable, 
 for example, branches in small communities.
 
 
 
Since 
 April, all new investing members have been required to sign away their 
 rights to any future "windfall" payment to charity for a period of five 
 years. The Newcastle took this move to discourage speculative investors 
 whose prime interest is in seeing the Newcastle disappear in return for 
 a one-off share of the reserves. As a result, the Society was once more 
 able to open accounts from as little as £1. It immediately welcomed 
 thousands of small savers with a genuine wish to save with a building 
 society.
 
As 
 for the long term future of the Newcastle, the board of directors continues 
 to review the pros and cons of conversion and other options. It takes 
 professional external advice and the directors are unanimous in their 
 belief that remaining an independent mutual is in the best interests of 
 members, employees and the wider community.
 
 
 
Business 
 Development
 
In 
 1999, building on its successful call centre, Newcastle Direct, the Newcastle 
 won the contract for the administration of direct mortgage sales on behalf 
 of Kensington Mortgage Company, the UK&#146;s biggest specialist in sub-prime 
 lending, creating 22 new jobs.
 
Products
 
Members 
 who had been saving with the Newcastle for five years or more were offered 
 a £6 m limited issue Loyalty Bond with a preferential 
 interest rate to complement the loyalty discount already offered to long-term 
 borrowers. The preferential interest rate was provided out of the Newcastle&#146;s 
 profit margin as a benefit to existing members. It is the Society&#146;s 
 intention to offer a similar account to long-term savers once a year.
 
The 
 RESI (Residential Enhanced Secured Indexed) Bond gave thousands of investors 
 the perfect opportunity to benefit from rising house prices and it raised 
 £45 m. The RESI Bond was launched with the help of investment company 
 Pinder, Fry & Benjamin. In 2000 the Newcastle will continue to work 
 with third party providers to devise innovative products for its members.
 
Nova 
 55 was launched as a direct result of feedback from "Meet the Chief Executive" 
 roadshows for members. It offered an attractive rate for savers aged 55 
 and over with easy access to funds. 
 
The 
 Newcastle also joined forces with other building societies to provide 
 a syndicated loan to the de Montfort University in Leicester. The deal 
 enabled the university to build new student accommodation and the other, 
 smaller, building societies to participate in a commercial loan which 
 they would otherwise have been unable to undertake.
 
Service 
 &#150; Providing a Choice
 
A 
 commitment to use emerging technologies sits side by side with the Newcastle&#146;s 
 continuing commitment to provide a branch service to new and existing 
 members. The Society recognises that many of its members enjoy face to 
 face contact in their local branch and will strive to maintain a local 
 community service at the same time as developing Internet services. It 
 is not a case of either/or, but of providing choice according to customer 
 preference.
 
Members
 
The 
 Newcastle researches its members each month and in 1999 
 over 95% of new borrowers stated they were 
 satisfied or very satisfied with the service. This is entirely due to 
 the consistently outstanding efforts of Newcastle Building Society employees. 
 
 
Staff
 
During 
 1999 the Newcastle revisited its human resources strategy and implemented 
 a number of initiatives to strengthen its ability to help staff at all 
 levels achieve their potential and enable the Society to identify and 
 train "new blood" for senior management. It was re-accredited as an Investor 
 in People for the third time.
 
Community
 
The 
 Newcastle Building Society Community Fund, established in 1999 donates 
 funds to grass roots charities and voluntary organisations wherever the 
 Society has a branch presence. This is in addition to the many community 
 sponsorships and in-kind assistance provided. 
 
Nottingham Imperial 
 Building Society Merger
 
In 
 February 2000 the Newcastle welcomed the members of the Nottingham Imperial 
 Building Society. The merger will contribute £54m to the Newcastle&#146;s 
 assets during 2000 and provide a broader range of services to Nottingham 
 Imperial members. Its former branch at West Bridgford has since been re-branded 
 and all staff have been offered employment.
 
The 
 Future
 
The 
 year 2000 promises to be every bit as challenging and exciting as last 
 year. The Newcastle&#146;s board of directors remains confident that the 
 Newcastle will continue to be at the forefront of new developments. It 
 will provide its members with first class products and services and the 
 benefits which only a mutual building society is able deliver.
