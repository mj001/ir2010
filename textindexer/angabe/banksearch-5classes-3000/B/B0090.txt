 BUILDING
 AND CONTENTS INSURANCE 
 It
 is essential that the property and its contents are adequately insured and
 the Society can arrange cover with a major insurance company to suit your
 needs. The insurance policy arranged will provide protection to your

 damage. It is a convenient, easy and inexpensive method of arranging your
 insurance needs. The amount of buildings insurance cover is based on a
 figure recommended by our valuers, the contents are automatically insured up
 to a maximum of £35,000. If your contents exceed this figure please advise
 the Society immediately.
 
Accidental damage
 cover is recommended to ensure you receive maximum benefit in the event of a
 claim.

 If you would prefer to pay your premium annually, please ask your local
 branch for further details.
 
The Society's
 arrangements with its Insurers for Buildings or Buildings and Contents
 Insurance do not require completion of detailed insurance proposal forms.
 However, a contract of insurance requires disclosure of all facts which an
 insurer would regard as likely to influence the acceptance and assessment of
 an insurance proposal.
 If you are in any doubt about facts considered material, you should disclose
 them. Failure to do so may affect the settlement of a claim or render the
 policy invalid.
 If any answer is YES, or you are in any doubt as to whether facts are
 material, please give full details on a separate sheet attached to this
 application form.
 You should keep a record (including copies of letters) of all information
 supplied for the purposes of entering into the insurance contract.

 you, or any member of your family normally residing with you:

 premium will be amended yearly and is likely to increase each year.
 If you wish, you may arrange the insurance through another nominated
 insurance company. The details of the insurance must be approved by the
 Society and reasonable consideration will be given to such a proposal. A
 charge will be made to cover the extra administration costs involved.
 Insurers and their agents share information with each other to prevent
 fraudulent claims and to assess whether to offer insurance including the
 terms via the Claims and Underwriting Exchange register, operated by
 Insurance Database Services Ltd. A list of participants is available on
 request. In dealing with your application this register may be searched. In
 the event of a claim, the information you supply on this form and the claim
 form, together with information relating to the claim, will be put on the
 register and made available to participants.
