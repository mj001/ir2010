 CROSS BUILDING SOCIETY
 SELF-BUILD AND RENOVATIONS
 
 
Support for you - All the way
 
 
Clay Cross Building Society is a local society based in 
 North East Derbyshire providing loans for the purchase of homes for more 
 than 140 years.
 
Our Heritage self-build mortgage helps you to purchase 
 land and provides finance for you as you build your own home.
 
We can lend to help you buy the land, provided that outline 
 planning permission has been granted for a dwelling on the plot you intend 
 to buy.
 
Once you have obtained detailed planning permission and 
 appropriate building regulation approval we can release funds to you at 
 various stages as the building work progresses.
 
 
The Heritage Mortgage Stages
 
 
Phase 1
 
Our Phase 1 loan will 
 enable you to purchase your plot of land. We can lend up to 75% of the 
 purchase price (or our valuation of it).

 provide you with funds throughout the construction. As your property is

 Protecting your self-build 
 property
 
It is important that 
 you have the correct insurance to protect you and your self-build property 
 during construction. 
 
 
If your builder is not registered with NHBC we recommend 
 that you arrange a suitable policy with an insurer such as Zurich Municipal. 
 In exceptional cases we will accept architect’s certificates issued at 
 appropriate stage during the construction.
 
We strongly recommend that you have third party liability 
 insurance. If your house is being constructed by a building contractor 
 we will need to see a copy of an appropriate Contractor’s All Risks Policy.
 
If you constructing the property on a self-build basis, 
 you should arrange a Self-Build Policy. This should cover damage from 
 subsidence, storm, impact, vandalism, fire and theft.
 
 
It’s Easy To See Why We’re The Best
