 'No Fuss, No Nonsense' 
 Mortgage For those looking for the simplest possible mortgage, our 
 'No fuss, no nonsense' mortgage is ideal. The rate is variable, the 
 terms are simple, there are no penalties and no additional products 
 or services need to be bought. 
 Simple, isn't it?
All mortgage products are available to applicants who are either 18 
 years or older.
 Your home will be taken as security for any loan advanced to you 
 by the Society. Your home is at risk if you do not keep up repayments 
 on the mortgage or any other loan secured on it.
