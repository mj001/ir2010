 Newbury 
 Building Society boosts Long Term Value options 
 
 
 
 
Newbury Building 
 Society has launched three new mortgage products that will give 
 borrowers seeking long term value a greater choice. They all feature 
 low APRs, which is the only way to compare the true cost of borrowing. 
 The APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is calculated in a uniform way 
 (regulated by legislation) and takes into account interest rate, 
 daily or annual interest, repayment method, cashback and fees. For 
 the first time, Newbury borrowers can opt for 'daily interest'. 
 These mortgages (Daily Tracker and Guaranteed Term) also track the 
 Bank of England Base Rate.
 COMPARE APRS WITH OTHER LENDERS! Also see homebuyers.
