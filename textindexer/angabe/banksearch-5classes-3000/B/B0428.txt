Additional service charges
If you ask for a service that we do not routinely provide for all borrowers - for example, if you ask us to supply photocopies of documents - we may make a charge. We've shown details of the charges for the most frequently requested additional services below and have provided these details so you are aware how much the charges are.
 
Occasionally, we will make an administration charge for a service which is not listed below. If you ask for such a service, we will always tell you if we intend to make a charge and how much it will be.
 
Where a charge applies, we may add it to your mortgage account. You are free to repay the charge in full immediately, or leave it on your account. If you leave it on your account, it will show up separately on your mortgage statements and interest may be applied.

Financial difficulty
Sometimes your personal circumstances may change in a way that is beyond your control, with the result that you find it difficult to maintain your mortgage payments or it becomes desirable/necessary to repay your loan. (Please bear in mind that with certain mortgages there may be a charge if you repay the loan within the first few years)
 
In such circumstances, please contact us - our specially trained staff will give you every possible assistance. Dealing with financial difficultly at an early stage usually makes problems easier to solve. You can talk to us in confidence and receive practical advice, including (if appropriate) information on other sources of help such as state benefits.
 
We keep in touch with customers throughout periods of difficulty, ensuring that everything possible is being done.
 
If you would like information about mortgage payment protection insurance, please see our Payment Protection Section.
