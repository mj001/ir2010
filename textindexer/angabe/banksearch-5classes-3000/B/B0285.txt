Birmingham Midshires - Phone a Boss!
Phone a Boss!
Birmingham Midshires is still the only leading financial services organisation to encourage its customers to give feedback directly to the executive team by calling them on their office number or, if you can't reach them there, at home. 
To tell us what you think about Birmingham Midshires' products or service standards, just pick up the phone.
We may need to monitor or record calls.
