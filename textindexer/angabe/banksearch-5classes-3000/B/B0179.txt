	Concessionary Discount Scheme +
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	After 4 years the rate changes to our variable rate, (currently 5.70%). But, with our Mortgage Discount Scheme you will receive a 0.5% discount off 
	the variable rate applicable to your mortgage at that time for the remainder of the mortgage term, so that you receive long term benefits and value for the full term of your mortgage.

	Legal fees package
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	If you are looking to re-mortgage up to 85% loan to value we will pay your legal fees (£250 cashback paid in Scotland) if you use our Home Conveyancing Service. 
	If you are looking to remortgage over 85% or to purchase and / or sell a property we have a great legal fee package. See our Skipton Home Conveyancing 
	Service section for details.
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	No redemption charge period
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	If at any time you wish to redeem the mortgage early, you will only pay interest to the end of the month of redemption. Even this is waived if you return to the Society for your new mortgage. Isn't it refreshing to have peace of mind with no long term lock-in periods?
	 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Free HPLF below 90% loan to value
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	If you wish to borrow more than 75% of the valuation or purchase price (whichever is the lower), the Society will charge you a High Percentage Loan Fee (HPLF). This fee will be used to protect the Society in the event that you default on your mortgage.++
	
	We will charge this fee as a one off premium which will be added to your mortgage account, even if it takes your total loan over 95%, where the valuation or purchase price (whichever is lower) is £40,000 or more. You can, if you choose, pay this so that it does not accrue interest as part of the loan.
	
	However, for loans between 75% and 90% of the valuation or purchase price, you don't have to pay a penny as we will credit your mortgage account with an amount equivalent to the HPLF on completion.
	 
	
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	How much can I borrow?
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	Provided you have been in permanent employment for at least three months, we'll lend up to 3.5 times your annual salary. If you're applying in joint names, the whole of your partner's salary can be added too. Or you can borrow 2.75 times your combined incomes. The maximum advance we'll grant with this scheme is 95% of the valuation or purchase price of the property, whichever is the lower.

	Skipton Insurance
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	If you opt for a Flexible Base Rate Tracker Direct with an insurance through the Skipton, you can choose whichever of these three excellent policies best suits your requirements. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 1
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton House and Contents is the ideal policy if you require comprehensive cover for your home and its contents. What's more, your personal possessions are covered automatically and the contents of your home are covered against accidental damage too. Make sure you ask for details of how you can receive 6 months Skipton Assured cover absolutely FREE when you take out this policy. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 2
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton Homeplan provides cover for your home and contents with a fixed level of contents cover of £30,000 - ideal if you require a limited level of cover. 
	
	
	
	
	Option 3
	 
	
	
	
	Skipton Assured provides security and peace of mind should you be unable to work through accident, sickness or unemployment. You really should think about taking out this essential payment protection insurance in addition to one of the household insurances. 	
	
	
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Mortgage Advice
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	Under the Code of Mortgage Lending Practice, lenders may either provide customers with advice or give information on the mortgage products available. We believe that choosing your mortgage is one of the most important decisions that you are ever likely to make, and we will advise you on what we feel is the most suitable product from our range to meet your needs. So when you're ready to talk over your application, just call into your local Skipton branch. Alternatively you can call Customer Services on 01756 705035.*

	Further Information
	 
	 
	 
	
	
	
	
	
- To take advantage of bank base rate plus 0.65% (for loans up to 85% loan to value) or plus 0.80% (for loans up to 95% loan to value), you need to take out one of the three insurance policies detailed above, which must be maintained for at least 5 years from completion.
	
- If there is a change to bank base rate during the first 4 years, your new rate will become effective 15 days after the base rate change.
	
- Monthly payments must be paid in advance by Direct Debit on the 1st of each month. The interest rates quoted include a 0.25% Direct Debit discount. If the Direct Debit is cancelled, this discount is removed.
	
- If the mortgage is repaid in full, interest to the end of the month of redemption will be payable.
	
- If you move house within 4 years of completion, the mortgage product is portable and can be applied to the new property. (Please note: Any concessionary Mortgage Scheme Discount is not portable).
	
- Minimum acceptable property value £25,000.
	
- The cost of valuing the property including a non-refundable administration charge of £45, is as follows:-

	NB The valuer's report is for mortgage purposes only and does not guarantee that the property is free from defects. You may require a Homebuyers report or Buildings Survey if you are purchasing a property. Ask your mortgage advisor for details.
	
	
	
	+It is intended that the Scheme will continue in force for the remainder of the term of the mortgage although the Board of Directors of the Society do have the right in their discretion to vary the terms of the Concessionary Scheme or to withdraw or to vary the amount of the scheme discount at any time. If they do so they will give you reasonable advance notice. The present view of the Board is that they would only be likely to do so as a result of exceptional circumstances arising from major changes in market conditions or general building society, banking or other lending practice.
	
	++High Percentage Loan Fees (HPLF) are used to provide extra security to protect the Society if you default on your mortgage and your property is taken into possession and is sold for less than you owe. This will protect the Society but it does not protect you. You will remain liable to pay all sums owing, including arrears, interest and our legal fees. If a claim is paid to the Society under a third party insurance, paid for out of the HPLF, the insurers will normally have the right to recover this amount from you.
