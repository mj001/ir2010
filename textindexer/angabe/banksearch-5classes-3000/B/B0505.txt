 * Our appointed solicitors 
 will be instructed by us to take care of the legal work involved 
 in a typical remortgage on Staffordshire Building Society’s behalf, 
 at no cost to you. All that you’ll have to pay yourself are any 
 non-standard costs that could arise - for example, if your advance 
 is for over £100,000 or the title to your property is unregistered 
 then you would have to pay any additional Land Registry fees. The 
 Society’s Solicitors will try to deal with any practical queries 
 you may have, but will not be able to give you legal, financial 
 or tax advice on your remortgage. We would recommend that you consult 
 your own solicitor or financial advisor if you require legal or 
 financial advice before signing any document we send to you or completing 
 your remortgage. Where additional fees are payable, details will 
 be provided to you by the Society’s solicitors. You will need to 
 pay these additional fees as instructed by the Society’s solicitors. 
 If your remortgage is more complicated, for example, it involves 
 a transfer of equity or a guarantor, you will need to instruct your 
 own solicitor instead.
