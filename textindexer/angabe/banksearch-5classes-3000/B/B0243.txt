Homecover
 
Buildings 
 and Contents Insurance specifically for Society borrowers
 
 
HOME INSURANCE 
 AT A RATE THAT IS RIGHT
 
WHAT 
 IS HOMECOVER?
 Homecover 
 is a special Home Insurance Scheme developed by Clay Cross Building 
 Society. It is offered as an alternative to the insurance cover on your 
 home buildings which is required as a general condition of the mortgage 
 advance.
 
Homecover also includes 
 contents, freezer contents, valuables, personal possessions, pedal cycles, 
 money and credit and cash cards.
 
Homecover provides 
 home and contents cover in a single policy at very competitive rates.
 
A brief summary 
 of cover is given within this leaflet - FULL POLICY WORDING IS AVAILABLE 
 ON REQUEST.
 
HOW 
 DOES IT WORK?
 Your home 
 buildings must be insured for an amount sufficient to cover the full 
 cost of rebuilding. The valuer when he inspects your property will recommend 
 an appropriate figure, but you should check this to ensure that it is 
 adequate.
 
A rebuilding cost 
 guarantee ensures that the full cost of the repair is paid even if this 
 exceeds the sum insured.
 
If the total valuables 
 in your home do not exceed £6,000 you are eligible for home cover.

If 
 you are still dissatisfied with your contract or personal insurance, 
 ie, not connected to any business activity, you can ask the Insurance 
 Ombudsman (IOB) to review your case. Their offices are situated at City 
 Gate One, 135 Park Street, London, SE1 9EA.
 
The 
 IOB will handle most complaints which you may have concerning a contract 
 of personal insurance. There are however a few instances in which the 
 IOB is not empowered to consider complaints.
 
You 
 may also contract the Customer Information Department of the Association 
 of British Insurers (ABI) at 51 Gresham Street, London, EC2V 7HQ.
 
If 
 you contact the IOB or the ABI in respect of any complaints, this will 
 not affect any right of action which you may have against us.

 and the Association of British Insurers.
 
It 
 is possible to choose the Law applicable to a contract of insurance 
 covering a risk situated in the UK. We have chosen Scottish Law to apply 
 if you live in Scotland and English Law to apply if you live elsewhere 
 in the UK.
 
Payment 
 of your premium is evidence of acceptance of our choice. If any other 
 law is to apply, it must be agreed by both parties and evidenced in 
 writing.
