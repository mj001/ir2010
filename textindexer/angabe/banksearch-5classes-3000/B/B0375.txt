	Fund Objective 
	
	
	
	
- To achieve long term capital growth from a portfolio made up of the shares of companies throughout the Pacific Basin, but excluding Japan.
	
	 
	 
	
	Investment Policy 
	
	
	
	
- The portfolio is likely to have a bias towards larger companies. However the Authorised Corporate Director is not restricted in the choice of company either by size or industry, or in terms of the geographical split of the portfolio, which is largely determined by the availability of attractive investment opportunities rather than the outlook for each market.

Please note past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance, the value of
units can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed. No product charges have been taken into account
except the fund management charge. Since July 1997 pension funds have been unable to recover tax deducted at source on dividends from UK equities.
Please note funds not designated in sterling may rise and fall simply as a result of exchange rate
fluctuations.
