Tiered rates of interest - 
the more you save, the more you could earn. The interest rates that we pay on 
this account may go up and down from time to time. 
 
This 
 account is not available to UK residents.
 
 
 
 
 
Interest 
 will be paid gross to non-taxpayers subject 
 to eligibility and the required registration. 
 Otherwise interest will be paid after deduction 
 of income tax at the appropriate rate (currently 
 20%). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Net 
 rates shown are for illustrative purposes only. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 AER 
 means Annual Equivalent Rate and shows what 
 the interest rate would be if interest was paid 
 and added each year. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 If 
 the capital balance in the account falls below 
 this minimum initial investment, interest will 
 be payable at the standard rate for the Investment 
 Share Account (excluding bonus) for so long 
 as the capital balance remains below the minimum.
