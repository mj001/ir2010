British Heart Foundation
 
Birmingham Midshires has joined together with the British Heart Foundation 
 under an extended relationship which will run until at least the end of 
 2003. Our aim is to develop an attractive range of services which not 
 only benefit you as a customer but also support the activities of the 
 British Heart Foundation. Each time you take out a product from the HeartBeat 
 Range, Birmingham Midshires is committed to making a donation to the British 
 Heart Foundation.
 
 When you apply (in phone, writing, or over the Internet) be sure to 
 mention that you wish to take the 'HeartBeat' version of 
 these products, and we'll help support BHF.
 
 
- The HeartBeat Flexible Mortgage gives the BHF £100 
 upon completion.
 
- Take out HeartBeat Home Protector mortgage cover, and 
 we'll donate £15 to the BHF.
 
- If you insure your buildings and contents by taking out HeartBeat 
 Selections, we'll donate £20 the the BHF.
 
- Put your money into the HeartBeat Savings account, and 
 Birmingham Midshires will make a donation to the BHF which is equivalent 
 to 5% of the interest we pay to you. The more you invest, the 
 more you earn - and the more we donate to the British Heart Foundation!
