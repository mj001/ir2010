Our 
 Lending Policy
 
The criteria used 
 by a lender in assessing an application is often just as important to 
 a professional introducer, or applicant, as the features of the mortgage 
 product. For your benefit the Newcastle Building Society has summarised 
 its Lending Policy. This is set out below.
 
Purpose 
 
 Residential 
 mortgages are available for the following purposes: 
 
 
- Purchase of a residential 
 property 
 
- Remortgages of 
 an existing advance 
 
- Capital raising 
 
 
- Construction of 
 a residential property 
 
 
Income 
 Multiples
 The maximum 
 loan we will advance is also subject to the following multiples:
 
 
 LTV 
 Multiple 
 of first income 
 plus 1 x second 
 Joint 
 income 
 
 
 Up 
 to 50% 
 4x 
 2.75x 
 
 
 51% 
 to 75% 
 3.5x 
 2.75x 
 
 
 76% 
 to 90% 
 3.25x 
 2.5x 
 
 
 91% 
 to 95% 
 3x 
 2.5x 
 
 
 
 *subject to 
 applicant being minimum of 25 years old. If under 25 years of age, maximum 
 over 75% is 3x. Regular monthly commitments will be deducted from income. 
 
 
Maximum 
 Advance
 The maximum 
 loan we will advance is as follows:
 
 
- For home and remortgage, 
 95% of the price or valuation of the property, whichever is the lower. 
 For certain products the maximum loan may be restricted. There is also 
 a restriction on properties with more than £250,000. 
 
 
 
 
- Remortgages for 
 capital raising purposes are not permitted on mortgages above 75% loan 
 to value. Capital raising is described as anything other than the replacement 
 of a home purchase loan or a loan for the purposes of home improvement. 
 In certain circumstances the Loan to Value can be increased to 85%. 
 
 
 
 
 
- Second homes/holiday 
 homes must be strictly for the sole use of the borrower and dependent 
 family members and must not be let. The maximum loan to value for such 
 properties is 75% and the applicants financial status must be sufficient 
 to cover both loans (i.e. mortgage on first property plus new mortgage). 
 
 
 
 
- For the construction 
 of a residential property, for owner occupation, 85% of cost or value 
 of the property, whichever is the lower. The maximum for the purchase 
 of the land is 75%. 
 
 
 
 
- All applicants 
 must fund their deposit from their own resources - it cannot be borrowed 
 from another party. 
 
 
 
 Purchase 
 Price Valuation
 All properties must have a minimum purchase price and / or valuation of 
 £25,000.

Status
 The following 
 points will be taken into account when considering the applicants ability 
 to meet mortgage payments.
 
 
- Employed applicants 
 must either have been with their present employer for at least six consecutive 
 months or, if less than 6 months, with a previous employer for at least 
 eighteen consecutive months. 
 
 
 
 
- Exceptions will 
 be made for certain professionally qualified applicants who have only 
 recently taken up employment. 
 
 
 
 
- Applicants who 
 have fixed term contracts within professional occupations such as doctors, 
 teachers and solicitors, will be regarded as in permanent employment. 
 Applicants from contract workers in other fields will be considered 
 on their individual merits. 
 
 
 
 
- Overtime/bonus/commission 
 must be a regular component of earnings and 50% of such earnings will 
 be taken into account. If the loan to value is no greater than 75%, 
 then 75% of such earnings will be taken into account. 
 
 
 
 
- We will consider 
 100% of unencumbered unearned income, including investment/pension/rental 
 sources up to 75%. The society would require a charge against any investment 
 income, if this is the only source of income. All cases must be referred 
 in the first instance.
 
 
 
 
- 
 
Income from a 
 second job will be considered at 50% provided that there is a minimum 
 of 12 months service. 
 
 
 
 
- Maintenance payments 
 will be considered at 100% subject to a court order or CSA. All cases 
 must be referred in the first instance. 
 
 
 
 
- N.B. Our criteria 
 for non-standard income, as listed above, applies to all applications, 
 irrespective of the loan required. 
 
 
 
 
- Applicants must 
 normally have been resident in the United Kingdom for a minimum period 
 of two years. This can be waived for members of the diplomatic corps, 
 a member of H.M. Forces, or employees of international based companies, 
 providing their family will be resident in the property. 
 
 
 
 
- We will run checks 
 on all our applicants addresses to cover the two year period preceding 
 the application. The results should confirm the applicants are registered 
 at the address and that no adverse entries exist. However, we will consider 
 applicants with one CCJ (Decree Scotland) or default up to £500 
 within the last three years,provided it has been satisfied, as well 
 as discharges bankrupt cases over four years earlier. 
 
 
 
 
- We will also check 
 the council of Mortgage Lenders possession register. If there is a positive 
 entry in the applicants name, we will be unable to progress the application. 
 
 
 
Information Requirements
 The following information is normally required in support of a mortgage 
 application:
 
 
- For employed applicants, 
 last three month&#146;s pay slips and most recent P60. Satisfactory 
 references covering the last two years will also be sought. Applicants 
 must be at least 21 years of age. 
 
 
 
 
- For self employed 
 applicants, the last two year&#146;s audited/certified accounts plus 
 a projection for the current financial year. Accounts must be audited/certified 
 by a chartered or certified qualified accountant. Applicants must be 
 at least 23 years old. 
 
 
 
 
- Self employed applicants 
 applying for a loan of more than 50% of the property value must provide 
 the last six months&#146; business bank statements.
 
 
 
 
 
- Proof of payment 
 for the preceding 12 months is required where the applicant has had 
 a previous mortgage or has been a tenant. 
 
 
 
- For all forms of 
 additional income which is being taken into account, documentary evidence 
 will be required. 
 
 
 
 
- In the event that 
 the applicants are not registered on the voters roll, they must supply 
 proof of residence. Any utility bill, council tax bill, voters roll 
 enquiries, bank statements or mortgage statements are acceptable, provided 
 the original documents are supplied. 
 
 
 
 
- Your solicitor 
 will be required to confirm identity by one of the following documents.

 the original documents are supplied. Proof of identity is not required 
 for existing Newcastle Building Society borrowers.

These guidelines outline 
 the main elements of the Society&#146;s residential lending policy, but 
 are not by no means exhaustive.
