National Trust Summer Spectacular
 
Our 
 Summer Spectacular events have now finished - we hope you enjoyed them 
 as much as we did!
 
You can visit the National Trust to see what other events they are organising 
 around the year, and don't forget to check back to find out what we'll 
 be doing in the future.
 
If you attended one of our events, and didn't pick up your reward leaflet, 
 take a look below - you can still ask us to send you one, so you can receive 
 a great deal on several Birmingham Midshires products!
 
 
 
 
What makes for even sweeter music are our special 
 offers...
 
When you attend an event, you'll be able to pick up a 'Reward Leaflet' 
 that will entitle you to the following great rewards:
 
 
- You will receive a £100 reward within one month of completion 
 when you take out a Birmingham Midshires Mortgage.
 
- We will give you a £20 bonus following receipt of your 
 first year's home insurance premium when you take out our Selections 
 Home Insurance.
 
- Open a Birmingham Midshires Savings or Investment account (with 
 a minimum deposit of £500) and an additional bonus of £10 
 will be credited to your account within 3 months of opening.
 
 
If you don't have a reward leaflet, click 
 here to send an email to the Alliances Team.
 
Please include your full name and postal address, and 
 we will put one in the post for you.
