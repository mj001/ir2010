Leeds & Holbeck, the
 UK’s eighth largest building society, today (Wednesday
 13 February) reports another record breaking performance
 in 2001.
 
 
- 
 
Assets increase to over £4 billion
 - only three years after passing £3 billion
 
 
- 
 
Record mortgage lending of £913m,
 30% higher than the previous year’s record total
 
 
- 
 
Non-interest income up by 13% to a
 record £16.4m
 
 
- 
 
Pre-tax profits up by 13% to a
 record £31m
 
 
- 
 
Cost asset ratio improves again to
 78p per £100 of assets (79p in 2000), one of the
 lowest for any bank or building society
 
 
- 
 
Interest margin of 1.23% is one of
 the lowest of any building society or bank and
 generated better rates for members worth more than
 £30m compared to the average for banks
 
 
- 
 
£22m rise in capital and reserves
 to £258m with solvency ratio further improved to a
 very strong 13.8%
 
 
- 
 
Membership expands to over 560,000,
 with the addition of over 45,000 new savers and
 borrowers in 2001
 
 
Chief Executive Ian Ward
 said: " Our results for 2001 are the best we have
 ever achieved with growth in all areas of the business.
 They clearly illustrate that being an efficient modern
 mutual is the best way to serve our members and achieve
 business success in a competitive marketplace.
 
"Nothing better
 symbolised our continued success than the growth in the
 Society’s assets to over £4 billion. This is both a
 significant milestone and an outstanding achievement
 coming only three years after we reached £3 billion of
 assets - a figure that took 123 years to achieve.
 
"In 2001 mortgage
 lending once again reached record levels with gross
 advances growing by nearly 30% to £913m. Our record
 gross lending was nearly £144m or 19% above building
 societies’ market share.
 
"Savings balances
 increased by £221m to a record level of £3.2 billion
 and we added over 45,000 new investing and borrowing
 members, taking the Society’s membership to over
 560,000.
 
"Our non-interest
 related income, which also grew very strongly by 13% to
 a record £16.4m, now represents 25% of Leeds &
 Holbeck’s total income.
 
"We again reduced
 costs to remain one of the most efficient building
 societies with a cost asset ratio of just 78p per £100
 of assets compared with 79p in 2000.
 
"Our interest
 margin of 1.23% remains one of the lowest of any
 building society. By contrast, many banks need to
 operate on much wider margins of 2% or more in order to
 pay dividends, which increases their outgoings by about
 40%. The difference between our margin and the average
 for banks was worth more than £30m to members last year
 through lower mortgage rates and higher savings rates.
 
"Pre-tax profits,
 which are up by 13% to a record £31m, ensured that the
 Society sustained its healthy capital position in order
 to support business growth. Capital and reserves grew by
 £22m to £258m and enabled us to increase our very
 strong solvency ratio to13.8%.
 
" Our excellent
 performance in 2001 means that Leeds & Holbeck is in
 great shape. We have the financial strength, the
 business strategies and products to build on the
 record-breaking success of last year. We have set
 demanding objectives for 2002 and look forward with
 confidence to another successful year."
