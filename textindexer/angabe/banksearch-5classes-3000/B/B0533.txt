 REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLE:
 
 Example based upon typical £32,000 Interest Only Mortgage over 25 years on a property valued at £40,000 at the Society's Standard variable mortgage rate of 5.69% discounted by 2.00% for 1 year then 1.00% for 2 years (typical APR 5.6% variable) assuming that the Society's Standard variable rate applies at the end of the discounted period for the remaining term of the loan. Monthly payments are 12 @ £99.00 then 24 @ £126.00 and 264 @ £152.00. Total amount payable 76,543.00 (excluding Buildings Insurance), including typical solicitor's or licensed conveyancer's fees of £153.00 (assuming purchase simultaneous with mortgage), and £50.00 sealing fee. Assumes completion on the first day of the month. For completions on other dates accrued interest will be charged from the day after release of the advance cheque until the end of the month in which completion takes place. A High Loan to Valuation Fee will be required for loans exceeding 75% of valuation of the secured property - amount due on quoted example FREE. We will normally require evidence that a suitable policy is in place which provides protection in the event of death during the repayment period. Based on quoted example for husband and wife borrowers (non-smokers) both aged 25 years (next) - typical endowment monthly premium £48.80 will be payable.
