Endsleigh Insurance is the insurance service for career people everywhere. It provides a wide range of insurance products, including household, travel, motor, pet, business and insurance for not-for-profit organisations, as well as independent financial advice. Founded in 1965 by the National Union of Students, the company quickly expanded into relationships with graduates and people in professional occupations and is now the preferred insurance supplier for a wide range of professional organisations, including the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, Association of University Teachers and Association of Optometrists, amongst others. 
In 1976 it was felt that a stronger financial base was needed to fully exploit market opportunities and Gouda Insurance Company of the Netherlands took an 86% share, with the NUS retaining 14%. In April 2002, the executive directors of the company, led by Managing Director Mike Alcock, undertook a management buyout and formed a long term strategic alliance with Zurich Financial Services. 
Endsleigh is an independent insurance intermediary, designing its own policies and using a range of insurers to underwrite them. It employs some 1,100 people across the UK, with its headquarters in Cheltenham and a large call centre in Burnley.
Whilst Endsleigh is better known as the pre-eminent student insurance organisation in the UK, Endsleigh has expanded its expertise to provide for a broader market. Trading as "independent insurance for career people", the formula of offering highly targeted niche products to the student community has been replicated with appropriate insurance products for graduates and professionals. This approach has proved very successful and will continue to be the focus for the business. The proposition to insure and retain students throughout their careers was further strengthened last year when a full independent financial advisory service was introduced. The commercial insurance division has also undergone considerable growth.
Endsleigh operates through an integrated multi channel distribution structure that includes 129 branches, call centres and a fully functional internet site.

Independent Financial Advice
Endsleigh offers Endsleigh Financial Independent Tailoring (EFIT), a unique service for Independent Financial Advice based on the telephone and internet. The majority of professional people are in need of financial advice but do not have the time to spend with a traditional adviser, who would visit their home. They often have a broad idea of what financial advice they require and are quite happy to receive information over the telephone at a time that is convenient to them. The Endsleigh website uses a wide range of calculators enabling clients to model their financial needs at any time and is backed up with direct access to qualified advisers via an on-line diary booking system. Clients choose when they wish to talk about their needs. EFIT selects from the entire market place and works on behalf of clients, not a particular company. 
 
EFIT offers the following products:
	
	
	
- Life assurance - family protection, mortgage protection, critical illness
	
- Income protection - sickness, accident and unemployment insurance
	
- Savings and investments - ISAs, bonds etc
	
- Retirement planning - personal pensions, stakeholder pensions, group schemes
	
- Mortgages
	
- Corporate Schemes - employee benefits, partnership protection, key person insurance
	
Affinity Relationships
Endsleigh is the independent insurance service for career people. This is borne out by the affinity relationships it has developed over the years with a number of professional organisations. Currently, Endsleigh is endorsed by the following organisations (as well as, of course, the National Union of Students):
National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT)
Association of University Teachers (AUT)
The University and College Lecturers' Union (NATFHE)
Association of Optometrists (AOP)
National Union of Maritime and Aviation Shipping Transport Officers (NUMAST)
Distribution
Distribution of Endsleigh products is via the website at www.endsleigh.co.uk, through 129 branches nationwide and via telephone call centres on its freephone number 0800 028 3571. Endsleigh uses sophisticated telephone systems that automatically direct a client to their local branch, wherever they are phoning from in the country. Staff are able to view a client's details on screen and see the totality of that person's relationship with Endsleigh, no matter which particular product or combination of products they have. This reduces the need for clients to speak to several people and means that Endsleigh staff have an overview of all that is happening on that account. In addition, all staff are encouraged to achieve professional qualifications and it is anticipated that by the end of 2003, all customer-facing staff will be professionally qualified.
