Hill House Hammond is a national insurance intermediary with 230 branches 
 throughout England, Scotland and Wales. In addition to being one of 
 the largest personal lines intermediary in the UK, HHH also has a developing 
 commercial insurance division. HHH is a wholly owned subsidiary of Norwich 
 Union. CGU and NU merged on 30th May 2000 to create CGNU - the 
 world's sixth largest insurer and the UK's largest insurer and insurance 
 group. 
 
Bristol based, the company was founded in 1959 by Arthur Holmes, who 
 set up an insurance brokerage under the name of Hill House. Initial 
 branches included Havant, Nottingham, London, Leeds and, with the opening 
 of the Severn Bridge, Wales. 
 
In 1983, Hill House was bought by Hill Samuel through its Lowndes Lambert 
 subsidary which had previously sold personal lines insurance under the 
 L Hammond name. The decision was then taken to merge the names of Hill 
 House and Hammond to form Hill House Hammond. By 1991, HHH had a network 
 of 133 branches when it was purchased by Norwich 
 Union. 
 
Today, HHH deals with a panel of leading insurance companies and services 
 the needs of 800,000 customers. 
 
The company offers a wide range of insurance products. Whilst motor 
 and home insurance policies make up its 
 core business, it also specialises in commercial policies for a whole 
 range of business sectors, from hotels and pubs to shops and factories. 
 Additionally, cover can be arranged for everything from a scooter to 
 an ocean-going yacht. HHH also has a specialist unit, based in Peterborough, 
 which deals with both British and American classic cars. 
 
The main strength of the company is its extensive branch network which 
 offers a local, face-to-face professional service, alongside a 7 day 
 a week national telephone call centre.
