Medical conditions
 It is very important that this insurance provides adequate cover for 
 your trip. To ensure that it does, and for your peace of mind, you must 
 tell us about anything which could give rise to a claim, particularly 
 where your own health or the health of any person on whom the trip depends 
 is concerned.
 
Pre-existing medical conditions
 Pre-existing medical conditions are not covered unless you have discussed 
 them with us and we have confirmed in writing that you will be covered 
 for them. If you have a medical condition, we will usually refer you 
 to a specialist medical assessment company for an independent medical 
 opinion.
 
For all quotations contact our expert staff on 0800 0151512 between 
 8 - 10pm Monday to Friday or 9 - 6pm Saturday and Sunday.
