	Overview 
	 
	
	
Canada is the eighth largest insurance market in the global with premiums amounting to about 6.5% of GDP. In 2000 it generated $46.59bn in premium income, accounting for 1.91% of the world market. Total premium income is almost equally split between life ($20.55bn) and non-life ($21.34bn). Some $5.6bn was spent on motor insurance, $164m on marine and aviation, and $4.78bn on accident and health insurance. General liability accounted for $1.13bn.
Canada has a market-oriented system, similar to the US. Real growth rates have averaged around 3% since 1993, while the NAFTA and the US-Canada Trade Agreement have added impetus to trade with its southern neighbour.
Over 230 private insurers participate in Canada's property and casualty (P&C) market, employing more than 100,000 people. Over half of its P&C premiums are for motor cover. The remainder is for property and liability insurance.
There is substantial participation in the Canadian market by foreign direct insurers and international reinsurers. Seven of the ten largest insurers there are foreign-owned and foreign insurers account for 68% of premiums earned.
Government-owned corporations provide some p&c cover too. Motor insurance is the area of greatest government participation. Provincial public companies supply this type of insurance in British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Quebec. These companies account for 32% of the Canadian motor insurance market.

	Legislation 
	 
	
	
Legislation is divided between the federal, provincial and territorial governments. The following are significant federal laws governing the Canadian insurance industry:
- Insurance Companies Act
- Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act
- Excise Tax Act

	Regulation 
	 
	
	
In Canada, the power to regulate insurance business is divided between:
- The federal government - which regulates capital, governance and solvency for insurers (such as Lloyd's) that operate across Canada through the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI);
- The provincial and territorial governments - which have jurisdiction over contract content, business practice, conduct and agent/broker/adjuster licences. It is the provincial/territorial governments which licence Lloyd's to write particular classes of insurance once a federal licence is obtained. Federal licences are not required to write marine and nuclear risks.
- Foreign companies must appoint a chief agent with power of attorney in Canada and maintain approved assets to cover their liabilities.

	Taxation 
	 
	
	
Excise tax
 
A 10% tax is levied on premiums on risks placed with authorised insurers through non-resident brokers, and on premiums on risks placed with non-authorised insurers. Exemptions: life, personal accident, sickness, marine and reinsurance.
Goods and services tax (GST)
Generally, insurance is considered an 'exempt supply' and premiums are not subject to GST. Some claims costs are subject to GST, others are 'zero-rated'.
Premium tax
The provinces and territories levy premium taxes on a variety of classes of insurance. These taxes are payable by the insurer.
Sales tax
The provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland levy sales taxes on premiums which are payable by the insured.
