Charities Connect
 
 
 
 
 It is increasingly recognised
 that charity organisations have different insurance requirements from other commercial
 enterprises. This is particularly so as far as the inclusion of voluntary workers is
 concerned and also the need for wide-ranging liability covers.
Charity Connect caters for these needs and a variety of specialist services that
 many charities provide. These include some types of employment and training,
 rehabilitation, residential care etc.
