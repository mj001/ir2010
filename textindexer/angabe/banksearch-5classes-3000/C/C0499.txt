BIBA
 £1,000 Bursary Awards
 For
 the Young Professionals of the Future
 
The British
 Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) believes that professionalism
 is vital to the future of the insurance industry. As part of its
 campaign to progress the professionalism of the future of broking,
 the Association is making some important Bursary cash awards this
 year to reward young people who are studying insurance or risk
 management as part of their degree courses.
 
 The total award can top £1,000 if the student successfully
 completes three stages of the application process.
 
 First Awards - £500
 
 An initial £500 award will be made to three candidates whose
 successful letter explains:
 
 
- why insurance is important in the 21st Century
 
- what they hope to achieve from their studies
 
- why the BIBA Bursary Award is important
 
 
Work
 experience gained by the applicant in insurance broking, before or
 during their degree course, or a serious interest in a career in
 insurance broking, will be considered an advantage.
 
 A CV and passport photograph must accompany the letter, together
 with a completed application form.
 
 
 Second Awards - £250
 
 If the student is awarded the initial £500, he or she must then
 complete a written assignment for the second round of awards, which
 can achieve a further £250. The assignment will then be judged
 again to find one winner who will receive a further £250, bringing
 the total prize money to £1,000.
 
 
- The assignment must be about risk management or
 insurance and be at least 2,500 words on A4 paper.
 
- The title of the piece must be agreed between the
 student and his/her college tutor and the BIBA bursary panel
 
 
Rules and
 entry requirements
 
 
- Applicants must be undergraduates, taking a
 degree course, which includes at least one unit covering
 insurance or risk management studies.
 
- Applicants for the bursary scheme must be
 nominated by their head of department. The BIBA judging panel
 reserves the right to contact the applicant's head of department
 for information on his/her progress and interest in the
 insurance broking industry as a career.
 
- All initial applications for the first stage of
 the bursary award must be received by BIBA not later than 30
 June, 2001.
 
- Bursaries will only be awarded in the academic
 year in which the applicant is undertaking his/her unit in the
 appropriate subject. If, however, the applicant is taking these
 units during more than one year of the course, the bursary may
 be awarded to the same individual for a maximum of three years,
 at the discretion of the BIBA bursary panel.
 
- Written assignments must be completed by the 30
 October 2001.
 
- Applicants may be required to attend a selection
 panel at BIBA House.
 
- Final selections will be made by the BIBA Bursary
 panel and remain entirely at the discretion of the members of
 the panel.
 
- All applications will be acknowledged.
