	ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE ANNOUNCES RECORD NEW LIFE BUSINESS THROUGH IFAs
	 
	
	
	
	
	15th February 2000 - 
	 
	
	
	
	
	The decision last year by Royal & SunAlliance&#8217;s UK Life & Unit Trust business to focus on the IFA marketplace is bearing fruit, with Life and Pensions new business through IFAs up 42% in 1999. The second half of the year was particularly encouraging with sales up 59% on the same period in1998. 
 Generally, UK new business sales of life, pensions and collective investments were up 29% from £1107 million to £1423 million. Single premium sales rose by 32% from £991 million to £1305 million, including a 48% increase in Single Premium Bond sales from £477.4 million to £706.7 million. Other growth areas were: 
> A 25% increase in collective investments up from £266.8 million to £332.4 million. 
 > A 12 % increase in Group Risk business to £34 million, 97% of which was brought in through IFAs. Steady growth in an area where we are already the market leader. 
 Regular premium life & pensions business showed positive growth of 2% to £118 million in a very difficult trading market. 
In annual premium equivalent (APE) terms, sales increased by 16% to a record £248 million. Stephan Pater, Managing Director, UK Life & Unit Trusts said: &#8220;1999 was an excellent year for us, both in terms of results and awards. We have seen top quality, profitable growth in our chosen markets and we are particularly pleased with the increasing level of business and support we are receiving from IFAs. This is testament to the success of our segmentation strategy and our on-going development of business partnerships with key customers in this market.&#8221; 
 Total life and pensions sales through IFAs increased by 42 % in 1999 (a 30% increase in APE terms) with most notable increases in the following areas: 
> 56% increase in With Profits Bond sales from £356 million to £555 million 
> An 85% increase in Progressive Protection business (the company&#8217;s, pay as you go term assurance) from £3.2 million to £6 million. 
 > Total new group pensions premiums up 47% to £52 million, including a 96% increase in regular premium contracted-in money purchase schemes, and a 29% increase in regular group personal pension schemes. 
 During 2000 the company will be building on this success in the IFA market by: 
 > increasing the current number of Broker Consultants by 40%, demonstrating the importance placed on face to face contact with IFAs. 
> developing E-business capability with the provision of a series of on-line services, including quotations and commission information. 
> and, increasing the focus on the group pensions market ahead of the launch of stakeholder pensions. 
 Stephan Pater commented: &#8220;These developments, together with our award winning investment management and quality, customer focused products, which are clearly meeting IFAs&#8217; needs, mean we are confident our growing position as a key player in the UK life market will be sustained.&#8221; 1999 New Business Figures - UK life, pensions and non-life investments 	 1999 (£m)	 % Change	 1998 (£m) Regular	 	 	 Life & Pensions	 118.02	 +2%	 115.58 	 	 	 Single	 	 	 Life & Pensions 	 973.32	 +34%	 723.81 Collective Investments* 	 332.4	 +25%	 266.8 Total Single	 1305.72	 +32%	 990.61 	 	 	 Total new sales	 1423.74	 +29%	 1106.19 	 	 	 Weighted figure (APE)	 248.59	 +16%	 214.64 	 *collective investments: Unit trusts, ISAs and PEPs - ENDS - For further information, please contact: Jan Halligan	Alison Burgess Royal & SunAlliance 	Shandwick International Tel. 0151 239 4432	Tel. 0171 905 2467 Notes to Editors > Awarded Life Insurer of the Year at the British Insurance Awards 1999. > Awarded Best UK Investment Management Group 1998 and 1997 by Standard & Poor&#8217;s Micropal. > Also named Best Individual Pensions Fund Manager in 1996, 1997 and 1998, and Best UK Life Insurance Fund Manager 1995 and 1998. > Worldwide funds managed by Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group plc exceed £57 billion. > Figures include, where appropriate, institutional investment into retail investments funds for 1999 and for the 1998 comparative.
