BIBA
 IT Forum launches software
 directory for brokers
 
 
 
First
 broker software directory helps brokers
 through maze of offerings 
 
 
 
A
 new software directory, developed by Garol
 Ltd in conjunction with the BIBA IT Forum,
 contains the first comprehensive overview of
 the capabilities and functionality of most
 of today’s broking software offerings. It
 was compiled by sending a detailed
 questionnaire to 16 software houses
 providing systems to brokers, covering 18
 different offerings.
 
 
 
The
 directory
 gives brokers the
 opportunity to compare different systems and
 their capabilities against the needs of
 their own businesses. Each entry is divided
 into the following broad sections:
 
 
 
§ 
 An overview
 of the system, including who developed it,
 who to contact for more information and the
 broad features and benefits of the system;
 
 
 
§ 
 Client
 management information, such as what
 information is stored, how it is used and
 what searching capabilities exist;
 
 
 
§ 
 The
 functionality of the system, covering
 support for EDI and reporting features;
 
 
 
§ 
 An overview
 of how the system handles data transfer,
 including the impact on your business;
 
 
 
§ 
 Accounting
 functionality, such as support for GISC
 practices, payment options and commissions;
 
 
 
§ 
 Information
 on the level of support the vendor supplies,
 including training, response times and
 disaster recovery;
 
 
 
§ 
 Technology,
 which includes hardware, software and
 Windows integration;
 
 
 
 Mike Williams, BIBA’s chief executive,
 said: "This CD software directory will
 prove invaluable to members who are
 inundated with the various offerings. It is
 often very difficult to work one’s way
 through the maze of systems in the market. 
 We believe this will help brokers to
 find the best system for their business, and
 we are grateful to the software houses for
 their support and for supplying information
 to help us to get this project up and
 running. It’s the first time that all the
 systems have been put to the test, and we
 are pleased that BIBA is leading the way
 with this initiative." 
 
 
 
How

The Software Directory is available at a discounted
 subscription rate for BIBA members of £125.00
 inclusive of 
 VAT and is supplied on CD ROM (please
