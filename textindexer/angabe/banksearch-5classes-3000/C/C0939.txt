Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance
 
MPPI Policy Wording
 (back)
 
3. The type of cover the policy provides
 
 
 
 The type of cover provided under the policy is unemployment 
 and disability insurance. This will offer you maximum protection 
 in the event of a claim. You can (if required) restrict 
 your policy to unemployment only cover or disability only 
 cover but you must be aware of the following facts: 
 
 
- if you take out unemployment only cover you will not 
 be able to claim for any disability. If you suffer a disability 
 during any period of unemployment, your monthly benefit 
 payments will be suspended until you are able to continue 
 actively seeking work; or 
 
- if you take out disability only cover you will not be 
 able to claim for any unemployment. If you become unemployed 
 during any period of disability, you will only be able 
 to continue to receive monthly benefit while you remain 
 disabled.
