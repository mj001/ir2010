MPPI Policy Features
 (back)
 
Why you should choose this policy?
 
 This policy will help you to protect your mortgage payments 
 and insurance premiums for up to 12 months if you become 
 unemployed or suffer a disability (accident or sickness). 
 
 
If you are taking out the policy to protect a new mortgage 
 or re-mortgage you will receive the first three months cover 
 completely FREE OF CHARGE. 
 
If you are taking out the policy to protect an existing 
 mortgage, then subject to the unemployment exclusion detailed 
 below, you will receive the first three months cover completely 
 FREE OF CHARGE. 
 
Unemployment Exclusion - if you are taking out the policy 
 to protect an existing mortgage, you will not be covered 
 against any unemployment, which occurs during the free cover 
 period. This exclusion will not apply if you transfer your 
 cover from another insurer; provided your existing policy 
 has been in force for at least six months and you have not 
 made a claim under that policy.
