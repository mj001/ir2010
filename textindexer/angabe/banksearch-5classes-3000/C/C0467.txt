Management Changes
 
 
The directors of Chaucer Holdings PLC are pleased 
 to announce that, subject to the approval of Lloyd&#146;s, the Group&#146;s 
 principal operating subsidiary, Chaucer Syndicates Limited (&#147;CSL&#148;) 
 will make the following management changes: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hugh Hayward, Active Underwriter of syndicate 
 1084 will, in addition, become Chairman of CSL. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bob Stuchbery, Active Underwriter of syndicate 
 1096, will relinquish that role and become Underwriting Director 
 with overall responsibility for the underwriting operations 
 of CSL. He will also become Chairman of the motor syndicate 
 587&#146;s recently formed Divisional Board. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ewen Gilmour, Operations Director of CSL, will 
 become Managing Director of CSL. He will also continue as Group 
 Finance Director. 
 
 
 
The following syndicate appointments will be made, 
 subject to the approval of Lloyd&#146;s: 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bruce Bartell, Deputy Underwriter of syndicate 
 1096, will become Active Underwriter of syndicate 1096. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mary Towndrow, Deputy Underwriter of syndicate 
 587, will become Active Underwriter of syndicate 587. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Rob Littlemore, Specialist Lines Underwriter 
 with syndicate 1096, will become Deputy Underwriter of syndicate 
 1096. 
 
 
 
Due to the divisional board structure within syndicate 
 587, the Board of CSL does not believe that it is currently necessary 
 to appoint a deputy underwriter of syndicate 587. 
 
 
The above changes arise as a result of the retirement 
 of Malcolm Mackenzie, chief executive of Chaucer, and Ray Brick, 
 underwriter of syndicate 587 at the end of March and April respectively. 
 
 
 
Malcolm Mackenzie has decided to retire early following 
 his recent ill health. Ray Brick, who will shortly reach his 58th 
 birthday, has decided that the time is right to hand-over to his 
 deputy Mary Towndrow. Ray Brick will continue as a non-executive 
 director of CSL.

In addition, CSL managed aviation syndicate 173 which 
 underwrote through a consortium arrangement with the Amlin PLC Group. 
 The consortium ended at 31 December 1998 and the result for the 
 1997 underwriting year is a loss of 7.7%, compared with the previous 
 forecast of &#150;12.5% to &#150;7.5%. The forecast range for syndicate 
 173&#146;s 1998 year remains unchanged from that previously announced 
 (-15.0% to -10.0%).
 
The results and forecasts are net of standard personal 
 expenses for an individual Name at managing agent&#146;s level (ie 
 after annual subscriptions, levies and managing agents&#146; fees 
 and commissions but before members&#146; agents&#146; charges). 
 The forecasts are made subject to the usual caveats that apply to 
 Lloyd&#146;s syndicate forecasts and are based on information prepared 
 for the 31 December 1999 Syndicate Returns. In addition, syndicate 
 173&#146;s forecast is dependent on the syndicate&#146;s final year 
 being closed as at 31 December 2000 into Amlin&#146;s syndicate 
 2001.

Funds switch
 
 In order to generate more income and to reduce volatility, the Board 
 of Chaucer Holdings decided to sell the Company&#146;s entire holding 
 of Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and invest the proceeds of £13.3 
 million in the Aberdeen High Yield Bond Unit Trust. The Company&#146;s 
 investments are currently valued at £39.5 million and now 
 comprise 88.6 million units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit 
 Trust and 13.4 million units in the Aberdeen High Yield Bond Unit 
 Trust. 
 
Martin Gilbert, Chairman of Chaucer Holdings, said: 
 
 
"Malcolm has been Chief Executive of the Group since its inception 
 in 1997, following a distinguished career at Lloyd&#146;s. We will 
 miss his leadership and experience and wish him a speedy recovery. 
 Ray has had a long and successful career at Lloyd&#146;s and I am 
 delighted that he will be on hand to help Mary Towndrow take over 
 the reins at syndicate 587.&#148; Malcolm 
 
Mackenzie, Chairman of Chaucer Syndicates, said: 
 
 
&#147;I am sorry to be leaving Chaucer at this time. Although much 
 remains to be done to fulfil the aspirations of both management 
 and shareholders, much has also been achieved in a very short space 
 of time. I look forward to seeing the Group fulfil its potential 
 as one of the leading underwriting businesses at Lloyd&#146;s&#148;. 
 Bob Stuchbery, Underwriting Director, said: 
 &#147;We are pleased with the 1997 results for our marine and non-marine 
 syndicates and their positive mid point forecasts for 1998, both 
 of which should compare very favourably with their peer groups. 
 Our motor side has suffered along with the rest of that sector and 
 although rates have been improving we will experience another loss 
 in the 1999 year.&#148;
