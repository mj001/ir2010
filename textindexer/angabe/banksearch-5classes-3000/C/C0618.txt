Understanding our Results
 
 
- The Modified Statutory Basis of Financial Reporting
- The Achieved Profits Basis of Financial Reporting 
The Modified Statutory Basis of Financial Reporting
Our results comprise an annual profit distribution to shareholders from our UK with-profits fund, as well as profits from out other businesses. Our primary UK GAAP financial statements are prepared under the modified statutory basis of reporting. For all our operations, other than our UK long-term insurance business, the modified statutory basis matches items of income and related expenditure within the same accounting period. This is achieved through the deferral of acquisition costs and application of the accruals concept.
For our UK long-term insurance business, the primary annual contribution to shareholder profit comes from our with-profit products. With-profit products are designed to provide policyholders with smoother investment returns through a mix of annual and terminal bonuses. Shareholders' profit in respect of bonus from with-profit products represents an amount of up to one-ninth of that year's bonus declaration to policyholders. The smoothing inherent in the bonus declarations provides for relatively stable annual shareholder profits from this business.
Within the modified statutory basis result, we focus on operating profit as the primary measure of current year performance. Operating profit excludes exceptional items, such as profit on business disposals, and includes the investment return for our UK shareholders' funds and personal lines property and casualty insurance business using long term rate of return, rather than the actual return for the year, in accordance with the modified statutory basis of accounting. For Jackson National Life, operating profit includes realised investment gains over five years. The analysis and discussion that follows is based upon operating profit.
For all our long-term insurance businesses (United Kingdom, United States and Asia), operating profit is generated principally from our in-force book of business. Our in-force book is business which was written in earlier years and on which we continue to declare bonuses to policyholders and generate profit for shareholders. These books of in-force business have been built up over many years with the result that, for our long-term insurance business, sales in any one year do not have a significant impact on shareholder profit in that year, but may have an impact in subsequent years. 
In order to identify value being generated by our long-term insurance businesses management also uses the achieved profits basis of reporting. The achieved profits basis uses discounted cash flows to show current value of future cash flows to shareholders of both new business and in-force business. 
The Achieved Profits Basis of Financial Reporting
The achieved profits basis of financial reporting is based on conventional accounting principles and recognises profit as it accrues over the life of an insurance contract. Although total profit from each contract calculated under this method is the same as under the modified statutory basis of reporting used for the main accounts, the timing of profit recognition is advanced.
The achieved profits basis can be illustrated by considering an individual contract. Using prudent best estimate assumptions of the main elements of future income and expenditure - investment return, claims, lapses, surrenders and administration expenses - the total profit expected to be earned from the contract can be estimated at the time of its sale. The total profit expected to be earned is then allocated to individual financial years by application of a discount rate, which allows for both the time value of money and the risk associated with the future shareholder cash flows.
Provided that the actual outcome is in line with the original assumptions, profits will be earned in each accounting period as the discount rate unwinds. The balance of profit not allocated to future years is recognised in the year of sale and is known as the profit from new business. The unwind of the discount rate and variances between actual and assumed experience during the remainder of the contract period produce the profit on business in force.
The additional profit recognised at an earlier stage under the achieved profits method is retained within the long-term funds and is known as the shareholders’ accrued interest in the long-term business.
The achieved profits basis is designed to report profit which reflects business performance during the year under review, particularly new business sales and fluctuations between actual and assumed experience.
The use of the achieved profits basis does not affect either the cash surpluses which are released to shareholders’ funds from the longterm funds, which continue to be determined by the directors following statutory actuarial valuations of the funds, or amounts available for dividend payments to shareholders.
The additional profit recognised using the achieved profits basis is represented by the shareholders’ accrued interest in the long-term business and, when combined with shareholders’ funds reported on the statutory basis, provides an improved measure of total shareholders’ funds of the Group.
