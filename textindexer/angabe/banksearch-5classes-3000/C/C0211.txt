Commenting on the results, Jonathan Bloomer, Prudential's Group Chief Executive said:
"We have continued to deliver our strategy of building an international retail financial services business by broadening our geographic presence, distribution channels and range of products to enable us to reach more customers and meet more of their needs.
"We have leading positions in key markets around the world and excellent customer access and reach. We are extremely well positioned to benefit from the growth in customer demand for asset accumulation and income in retirement with a business model that has an efficient cost base, financial strength and diversity of earnings by geographic region and product.
"The success of this strategy has been demonstrated in our performance during the year. We have made real progress in restructuring and re-focusing our UK insurance operations and its strong performance in 2001 shows that we can build the business in competitive markets while driving through these changes. There has been continued strong investment performance at M&G and Egg broke even in the fourth quarter as planned. Jackson National Life had its second best year ever for total sales as well as record sales of fixed annuities, and Prudential Corporation Asia had another year of exceptionally strong growth across the region.
"This performance was particularly pleasing because it was achieved against a backdrop of tough market conditions for many areas of our business. Turbulence in capital markets has led to credit losses and a fall in embedded value. However, the overall Group results reflect the fact that Prudential is a financially strong company with outstanding businesses and a broad international base.
Group total insurance sales, on an annual premium equivalent (APE) basis, of £1.8 billion were up 16 per cent and sales of investment products of £1 billion increased from £376 million in 2000. Achieved basis operating profits (after restructuring costs) increased by 15 per cent to £1,186 million. New business achieved profits were up 10 per cent, principally due to strong growth in Asia. Total in-force achieved operating profits increased 24 per cent to £673 million, despite a £74 million charge relating to average realised bond losses in the United States.
"As part of our ambition to build a business with long-term sustainable growth, we have set a goal for the next four years of doubling the intrinsic value of the Group. We define intrinsic value as the discounted value of the cash generated by the business in the future. This can be approximated to the sum of the embedded value together with a multiple of new business profits for our long-term businesses, and the fair value of non-insurance operations such as Egg and M&G. In order to achieve this goal, we will need to broadly double new business achieved profits and the fair value of our non-insurance operations. This is a stretching target, the key to which is performance delivery and our ability to develop the business so that growth will continue after the four year period, and one which is consistent with our focus on delivering value.
"The markets in which we operate around the world are experiencing significant change, bringing challenges but also enormous opportunities. This change is being driven by a number of factors including demographic shifts, changing regulation and government policy, different consumer attitudes, greater consumer sophistication, market reform and liberalisation, and increasing competition. Prudential, with its AAA financial strength, comprehensive distribution, product innovation and scale operations is well placed to meet these challenges and take advantage of the opportunities they present."
UK and Europe
"In the UK, we have complementary businesses and market-leading positions in key product areas, enabling us to deliver sustained growth in the low margin environment in which we now operate. Our UK insurance operations have undergone an enormous transformation in recent years and the development of our business model to improve our service to over seven million customers continued in 2001. We made changes to our direct sales channels and customer service operations and set out a more focused strategic direction for the business, creating further cost efficiencies and bringing together our operating units under the powerful Prudential brand.
"M&G’s market position, investment capabilities and brand strength make it one of the leading fund managers in the UK. The successful integration with Prudential Portfolio Managers has created a focused business with strong positions in all of its markets. Investment performance continues to be encouraging against difficult market conditions. Within the retail market, M&G has materially increased market share during the year, and on the institutional side has won a number of sizeable new fixed income mandates on the back of the growing trend among defined benefit pension schemes to seek to cap their liabilities.
"Egg’s full-year results were announced on 25 February 2002. Since we launched Egg in 1998, it has become one of the UK's leading e-commerce financial brands and the leading digital bank worldwide. In November, Egg achieved a break-even position and in doing so, met the commitment made at the time of its flotation in June 2000 that it would break even during the fourth quarter of 2001. Egg’s management team is confident that its UK business is sustainably profitable. Customer numbers now stand at over two million, and in January of this year, Egg announced details of its planned launch in France during 2002 including the acquisition of Zebank, the first digital online bank in France.
"In Europe, Prudential had a number of notable achievements during the year including the opening of a Paris-based branch, the launch of Prudential Europe Vie, an equity-backed life insurance product that builds on the success of Prudence Bond in the UK, and the signing of an additional distribution agreement with Centre Francais du Patrimoine, one of the largest multi-product broking services in France."
United States
"2001 has been a year of considerable uncertainty for markets, particularly the capital markets, in the United States. No one in the US has been immune from these difficult market conditions and Jackson National Life (JNL) was no exception. However, long-term demographic trends are favourable and we believe that there are significant growth prospects, bringing with it outstanding opportunities for high quality businesses like JNL.
"JNL is one of the top 20 life insurance companies in the United States in terms of total assets. Since we acquired it in 1986, JNL has been transformed into a market leading provider in its chosen product lines and distribution channels. While its performance during the year was affected by the continued market volatility in the US, particularly in areas such as variable and equity-linked products, JNL's broad product and distribution mix enabled it to deliver strong results in other areas including fixed annuities and stable value products.
"When combined with its considerable operating efficiency, low cost base and modern IT systems, JNL's diversified product portfolio and variety of distribution outlets enables it to continue writing profitable business in difficult economic conditions. Our ambition to grow the business remains and we will continue to develop JNL's product range and enhance its distribution channels to ensure that it is well placed to benefit from the anticipated growth in the US financial services market."
Asia
"The Group had another year of success and impressive growth in Asia. Prudential Corporation Asia (PCA) now operates in 12 countries, having added Japan and Korea to its geographic mix during the year, and it already has top five market positions in eight businesses across the region.
"PCA's performance in 2001 (new business achieved profits were up 67 per cent) endorsed its successful strategy of entering new markets, strengthening and diversifying distribution channels, and launching innovative, customer-focused products. The prospects for the long-term savings markets will continue to be significant across Asia, and represent an excellent opportunity for companies like Prudential with its financial strength, trusted brand name, strong joint venture partners, track record of success in the region, and a commitment to meet local customer needs with innovative products."
Summary
"2001 has been another year of considerable success and achievement for the Group and the benefits of our strategy of diversification by product and distribution channel internationally are very clear. Prudential is one of only 10 insurance companies worldwide with AAA financial strength ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. We have some truly outstanding businesses across the Group and through our focus on delivering value rather than volume as well as our active management of capital, I believe that we are very well placed for the future."
The final dividend of 16.7p per share will be paid on 29 May 2002 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 22 March 2002. Shareholders will once more be offered a scrip dividend alternative.
