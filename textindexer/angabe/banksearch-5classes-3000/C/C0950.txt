	The reason the Government introduced the Individual Savings Account (ISA) in 1999 is the same reason Scottish Friendly was established almost 150 years ago - to make saving and investing a possibility for everyone.
You don't need to be an investment expert and you don't need to invest a large lump sum to take out an ISA. Scottish Friendly's straightforward ISA choice is designed to make your money grow over the medium to long term (i.e. over at least 5 years). And with our history and success in tax exempt investments, who better to manage your ISA.
	
	
	
	 
 
 
 
	
	
	
	 
	
	 
	Stocks and Shares ISA
	 
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
Over the long term, the stock market is the place where your money has the greatest potential to grow into a substantial lump sum. Our Stocks and Shares ISA offers you a choice of two funds - the Managed Growth Fund and the UK Growth Fund. You can split your investment or invest solely in one. Invest from £30 per month or a maximum lump sum of £7,000.
	
	
	
	 
 
 
 
	
	
	
	 
	
	 
	Bonus ISA
	 
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
If you're looking for more growth potential than you're likely to get from a building society but don't want to take the risk of the stock market, consider our Bonus ISA. It's the insurance component of the ISA and you can invest from £30 a month up to a maximum lump sum of £1,000. The Bonus ISA is a with profits plan.
