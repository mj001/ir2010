*The 1998 year of account of syndicate 
 587 has been left open due to the uncertainty that arises pending 
 resolution of a reinsurance dispute. The position shown is as determined 
 at 31 December 2000 and may change depending on the outcome of the 
 dispute. 
 
Forecasts for the 1999 underwriting year of account 
 and a comparison to the previous forecasts made at the time of publication 
 of the 30 September 2000 Syndicate Quarterly Returns are shown below:

In addition, CSL managed aviation syndicate 173 which 
 underwrote through a consortium arrangement with the Amlin PLC Group. 
 The consortium ended at 31 December 1998 and the result for 1998, 
 being the syndicate&#146;s final year, is a loss of 15.6%, compared 
 with the previous forecast of &#150;16.0% to &#150;12.0%. The 1998 
 year of account of the syndicate is being reinsured to close into 
 syndicate 2001 which is managed by Amlin Underwriting Limited.
 
The results and forecasts are net of standard personal 
 expenses for an individual Name at managing agent&#146;s level (ie 
 after annual subscriptions, levies and managing agents&#146; fees 
 and commissions but before members&#146; agents&#146; charges). 
 The forecasts are made subject to the usual caveats that apply to 
 Lloyd&#146;s syndicate forecasts and are based on information prepared 
 for the 31 December 2000 Syndicate Returns.
