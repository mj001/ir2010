Annual 
 Multi-trip Travel Plan
 
POIS 
 Member Services offer a travel plan that not only provides a great range of 
 cover but has very competitive premiums. 
 
 
No 
 Claims Discount
 
If 
 like the majority of holidaymakers you have never needed to make a claim we 
 think you deserve a better deal. That&#146;s why if you have not made a claim 
 in the first year we will cut your 2nd year&#146;s premium by 10%. If the 
 situation stays the same, we will reduce your 3rd year&#146;s premium by a 
 further 5% to 15%, the 4th year&#146;s reduction would increase to 20% and 
 from then on we will slash your annual premiums by a massive 25%. (These 
 discounts are reductions against the standard annual premium, prevailing at 
 the time.)
 
 
Premiums
 
Although 
 the premium is an annual payment, we do offer the option to pay this by monthly 
 instalments through Direct Debit. We can also accept premiums by Credit/Debit 
 card.
