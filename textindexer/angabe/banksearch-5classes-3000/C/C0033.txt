	It’s hard to believe, but pets share many of our human characteristics. For instance, did you know that when cats have emotional problems, they can drink up to three times more than usual? It’s also common for pets to feel depression, grief, love and anxiety. They can even suffer from sunburn in the summer and therefore benefit from a touch of suncream on their ears.
