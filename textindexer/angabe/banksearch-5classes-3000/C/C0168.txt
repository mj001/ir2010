UK Life Insurance
Decreasing Term
(Mortgage 
Protection) Often used to protect a repayment mortgage, 
the sum payable on death reduces broadly in line with the outstanding amount of 
the mortgage. The policy is taken for a fixed period of time (usually the term 
of the mortgage) with fixed 
monthly premiums. Because the amount of cover reduces during the term 
of the policy, this type of policy is usually cheaper than Level Term. 
APPLY
Level Term
This type of policy provides a guaranteed level of cover for a fixed period 
(known as the term) at a fixed monthly premium. On death during the term of the 
policy, a lump sum is payable. There is no surrender or cash-in value to the 
plan and if premiums cease, the cover ends. 
APPLY
Critical Illness cover
This benefit can be added to the life policies or can be a stand-alone policy. 
The aim is to protect you financially in the event of you suffering with a range 
of specified illnesses. For example, heart attacks and cancer. The benefits are 
paid on diagnosis of the illness and can be used to pay off the mortgage, make 
changes to your home, medical treatment etc.
