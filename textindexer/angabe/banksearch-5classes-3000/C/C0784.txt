4. The number of people who can be insured (the benefit 
 split)
 
 
 
If your mortgage is in your name only, or your mortgage 
 is in joint names and you are the only person who is eligible 
 for cover, we will issue single cover in your name. 
 
If your mortgage is in joint names and both of you are 
 eligible for cover, you have the following options:
 
 
 
- you can take out single cover in your name and be insured 
 for 100% of the monthly benefit provided that you are 
 the main income earner. The restriction relating to main 
 income earner will be waived if both parties to the mortgage 
 wish to be insured for 100% of the monthly benefit by 
 taking out two separate policies; or,
 
- you can take out split cover and you will both be insured 
 for a percentage of the monthly benefit. If you make a 
 claim, we will divide your monthly benefit in the same 
 percentage as the normal income of each person at the 
 commencement of the claim.
