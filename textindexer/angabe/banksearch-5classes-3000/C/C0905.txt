Claims
We pride ourselves on our ability to deal with claims fairly and quickly.
Because of the quality and integrity of the insurance companies we trade with, most claims require little or no negotiation. The insurers are very keen to attend to claims in a professional way for our customers.
But sometimes, we have to negotiate increased settlements on behalf of our customers. If there is a problem our experienced staff are skilled negotiators, and because of our reputation and standing within the industry, as well as our excellent relationships with the carefully selected insurers we work with, we can invariably resolve any disputes quickly and to your satisfaction.
