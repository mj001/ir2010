	NEW TECHNOLOGY NOT TO BLAME AS STRESS FIGURES SOAR
	 
	
	
	
	
	1st November 2000 - 
	 
	
	
	
	
	Research recently commissioned by the International Stress Management AssociationUK (ISMA) and Royal & SunAlliance (R&SA) reveals that 70% of UK adults have experienced stress in the workplace. Nearly half (49%) of those who experienced stress at work, indicated that it had increased over the last 12 months. 
 More/&#8230; Stress&#8230;2 The survey, conducted to support National Stress Awareness Day TM on 1 November, shows that the nightmare vision of electronic overload pushing stress levels to the limits has failed to materialise. More than half of those interviewed (52%) &#8216;disagreed strongly&#8217; that new technology was the cause of workplace stress. In fact, a third of all workers believe that their quality of life has been improved by e-technology. ISMA&#8217;s Carole Spiers, Chair of the National Stress Awareness Day Committee, said: &#8220;This is the third year that we have conducted research on UK stress levels, and the figures of seven out of ten working adults experiencing stress make shocking reading. Companies clearly have a massive problem on their hands which they cannot afford to ignore. Unless they implement practices, policies and procedures to reduce stress, it will impact on their performance and ultimately their long-term success.&#8221; 
The pace of work and the difficulty of combining a hectic job with home life means more responsibility on employers to provide support and assistance for their employees in the form of practical measures. 31% of those surveyed admitted that they found balancing work and home life stressful. 
Carole continued: &#8220;Technology may not be the culprit, but there are plenty of other factors that contribute to stress in the workplace. These can be work overload caused by downsizing, longer hours, bullying, pressure to perform and lack of job security.&#8221; 
The purpose of National Stress Awareness Day (organised by ISMA, and in its second year of sponsorship by R&SA) is to raise the issue of stress management and firmly place it on the public agenda. More/&#8230; Stress&#8230;3 Commenting on R&SA&#8217;s sponsorship of National Stress Awareness Day, UK Public Relations Manager, Mike Wallwork, said: &#8220;The removal of stress is at the heart of our business and the service we provide is all about taking the stress out of everyday situations. With counselling and advice lines, R&SA provides a sympathetic ear to complement our products that protect people.&#8221; 
He concluded: &#8220;Our research shows that stress is a problem that is not going to go away unless we all pull together to identify and address the main causes. We are confident that by raising the profile of stress management, we can help clear up some of the common misconceptions that surround stress and provide some practical, preventative measures that really make a difference.&#8221;
