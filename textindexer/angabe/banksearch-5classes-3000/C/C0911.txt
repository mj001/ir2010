 The results 
 and forecasts are net of standard personal expenses at managing 
 agent’s level (ie after annual subscriptions, levies and managing 
 agents’ fees and commissions but before members’ agents’ charges). 
 The forecasts are made subject to the usual caveats that 
 apply to Lloyd’s syndicate forecasts and are based on information 
 prepared for the 31 March 2001 Syndicate Returns. 
 
 
 The forecast loss for syndicate 1096 has increased and the 
 range widened as a result of the potential need to strengthen reserves 
 against certain long term liabilities. 
 The above forecasts and 31 December 2000 forecasts for the 
 Group’s £15.6 million spread portfolio show a potential mid point 
 loss on the Chaucer Group’s 1999 year of account underwriting participations 
 (other than those relating to the recent acquisition of BRIT Insurance 
 Holdings PLC’s interest in Chaucer Dedicated Limited) of 12.8% of 
 capacity which is within the 5% to 15% range of losses covered by 
 the Group’s stop loss policy on that year of account. 
 The Group has already made provisions up to the value of 
 the policy threshold.
