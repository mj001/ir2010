	ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE LAUNCHES MORE TH>N &#8211; A NEW DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER BUSINESS
	 
	
	
	
	
	13th June 2001 - 
	 
	
	
	
	
	Royal & SunAlliance (R&SA) launches a major new retail initiative this weekend aimed at establishing it as one of the UK&#8217;s leading providers of direct-to-consumer personal financial services solutions. Sunday (17 June) sees the start of a multi-million pound marketing campaign to promote the company&#8217;s new retail brand, MORE TH>N from Royal & SunAlliance, which will offer direct services via the internet and telephone to customers across the UK. 
MORE TH>N will immediately be serving the needs of Royal & SunAlliance's existing two million direct customers from its general insurance, life and investment businesses. Offering levels of service and product propositions that go beyond what has traditionally been available from the insurance industry, MORE TH>N is confident of significantly expanding this customer base. 
Paul Spencer, Chief Executive of Royal & SunAlliance UK, commented; &#8220;This is a major development for Royal & SunAlliance. We&#8217;ve created an innovative new direct business that I believe will change the way people think about financial services in the UK. We think that what we&#8217;ll deliver will surprise and impress the UK consumer and that MORE TH>N will quickly become a household name.&#8221; 
MORE TH>N&#8217;s extensive product range includes home, motor, life, health, pet, and travel insurance as well as savings and investments. But it offers much more than this. Customers will benefit from complementary services to make their lives easier &#8211; from free email reminders of when their MOT or car tax is due, to an on-line portfolio tool enabling them to keep track of all their investments. 
The website &#8211; www.morethan.com - is full of lifestyle information and fun features to help individuals get the most out of life. For example, there&#8217;s advice on finding the right breed of dog for you, practical help on how to make a house move go smoothly, tips on how to make the most of your weekends and even special recipes for fussy children. 
MORE TH>N believes its high levels of customer service and tailor-made solutions will encourage consumers to select more than one product from its range &#8211; the aim being to achieve an average of three MORE TH>N products per customer by 2005. The business also intends to acquire more than 400,000 new customers each year. 
The launch of MORE TH>N has been 18 months in the planning. Royal & SunAlliance has invested £20m in customer and &#8216;e&#8217; systems development and a further £20m will be spent on marketing during the remainder of the year to create substantial public awareness of the new brand. This includes a four-week advertising campaign beginning on 17 June, which features Lucky, a mischievous family dog. The campaign involves television, press and posters and is supported by significant direct marketing activity. 
Explaining the rationale behind the new business, MORE TH>N Managing Director Adrian Brown said: &#8220;This is not an unproven &#8216;start up&#8217; operation. It is something new and exciting, but it&#8217;s from a company that people know and trust. Our strategy is based on harnessing all the benefits that e-commerce can offer in terms of speed, flexibility and convenience, and bringing together and expanding our product range to provide a customer focused business built on excellent service delivery.&#8221; 
He continued: &#8220;People expect much more from financial services companies today and this came through loud and clear in the research we carried out. Customers said they wanted a modern and fresh &#8216;one-stop&#8217; shop approach from a company they trusted &#8211; a service they could access when they wanted, where they wanted and how they wanted. Put simply, an offering that makes their lives easier. MORE TH>N will deliver this through award winning Customer Service Centres and via the web at www.morethan.com.&#8221; 
Paul Spencer concluded: &#8220;The launch of MORE TH>N demonstrates our strategy of providing our customers with the choice of how they do business with us, whether that is through intermediaries or corporate partners, or direct with us through MORE TH>N. Our new business will give us a strong presence in the direct market and a high profile with the consumer. The investment we have made and will continue to make in technology and systems will ensure that we are quick to respond to market conditions and to the changing demands of our customers.&#8221;
