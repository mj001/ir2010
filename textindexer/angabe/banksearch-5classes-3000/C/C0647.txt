Affordable tax-free savings
 
The Tax Exempt Bond gives you an easy way to 
 save for your family&#146;s future - without paying tax. Thanks to the special 
 status the Government gives friendly societies, our savings plan pays virtually 
 no tax on the growth it achieves and neither do you when it pays out. 
 
The plan offers you a choice of savings levels 
 &#150; from £15 a month up to £25 a month, which is the maximum 
 the Government will currently allow.
 
Premiums are payable for a minimum of 10 years 
 with an initial maximum of 25 years. At the end of the initial term, you will 
 have the option to continue paying premiums for a further 10 years. This option 
 will be repeated until the policy is encashed or there is less than 10 years 
 until the member&#146;s 85th birthday.
