Key 
 considerations
 
 
 
 
 90 families a day had their homes repossessed in 2000. The majority 
 due to the financial problems associated with unemployment.
 One in three people aged between 25-34 have experienced unemployment 
 for a period in excess of one month.
 Almost one in five working age households (3.4 million) have 
 someone who is currently unemployed.
 Today in Britain there are over 1,000,000 persons who are registered 
 as unemployed
 Every day 500 people in the UK become unemployed. 60% of unemployed 
 men and 45% of unemployed women will be out of work for six months or 
 more.
 Every adult in Britain is five times more likely to suffer a 
 serious disability than die before the age of 60.
 Today in Britain, 2,900 people will start claiming State disability 
 benefits
 1,800,000 people in Britain are already disabled and have been 
 unable to work for 12 months or more.
 
 
Will 
 the State help?
 You can no longer rely on the Government. State benefits for a single 
 person are currently under £60 per week. Could you manage on that? 
 The typical State benefit for two adults with two children is £96 
 per week; the maximum is £134 per week. Could you support your family 
 on this?
 Since October 1995 new mortgage borrowers will receive no State help for 
 the first nine months of unemployment or disability. Existing mortgage 
 borrowers receive nothing for the first two months, only 50% for the next 
 four months and then full benefit for mortgages of up to £100,000 
 provided they qualify for Income Support. The Government themselves estimate 
 that 70% of mortgage borrowers will not get Income Support due to savings, 
 income, or a working spouse or partner.
 In 1998 alone, the introduction of a new incapacity criteria resulted 
 in 102,000 claimants being turned down for State benefit. An independent 
 doctor (not your own) will carry out your assessment and you must be incapable 
 of doing any work, not just your normal job, to qualify for State benefit.

How 
 will 
 help you?
 GOODMORTGAGEprotection 
 can help you protect your monthly mortgage payment* (known as monthly 
 benefit) if you lose your job due to unemployment or you are unable to 
 work due to a disability (accident or sickness). You will also be entitled 
 to receive FREE COVER benefits at the start of your policy.
 
 The FREE COVER benefits you receive will depend on whether you are classed 
 as being a new mortgage borrower or an existing mortgage borrower. Full 
 details are provided in sections 7 and 8.
 
 * mortgage payment means the normal monthly payment you 
 make to your lender for the mortgage on your own private residential property. 
 
 This can also include the normal monthly premium for the policy you use 
 to pay off your mortgage and the monthly cost of your buildings and contents 
 insurance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3 
 How 
 do you apply for cover under ? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provided 
 you are able to meet the eligibility requirements detailed in section 
 4, all you need to do is complete and return the application form 
 and direct debit mandate. The FREE cover benefits provided under GOODMORTGAGEprotection 
 are subject to your bank or building society accepting your direct debit 
 mandate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4 
 Who 
 is eligible for cover under ? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There 
 are certain eligibility requirements you will need to meet at the policy 
 start date (or at any subsequent amendment date). Details of these are 
 provided below:
 
 
 
- You 
 must be aged 18 or over and under 65 and be permanently resident in 
 the United Kingdom, Channel Islands or Isle of Man.
 
- You 
 must be in work (work means actively working in the United Kingdom, 
 Channel Islands or Isle of Man for a minimum of 16 hours per week).
 
 
- You 
 must have a mortgage on the private residential property you occupy 
 as your home.
 
 
- You 
 must complete the application form and direct debit mandate and agree 
 to be bound by the policy terms and conditions.
 
 
- You 
 must not know that you will become unemployed or have any reason to 
 believe that you may become unemployed.
 
 
- You 
 must not be employed on a casual, temporary or seasonal basis (including 
 casual, temporary or seasonal contracts), or in any type of occupation 
 where unemployment is a regular feature of that particular job. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5 
 How 
 long do you wait before receiving your first monthly benefit payment? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You 
 will need to be continuously unemployed or disabled for a period of either 
 30 or 60 consecutive days before you are able to claim benefit under GOODMORTGAGEprotection. 
 The options available to you are detailed in section 20. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6 
 For 
 how long do you receive benefits in the event of a claim? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You 
 can receive monthly benefit for up to 12 months for each separate period 
 of unemployment or disability. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7 
 
 What type of free cover does provide 
 for new mortgage borrowers? 
 
 
 
 
 If 
 your policy start date occurs within 30 days of the completion date of your 
 mortgage you are classed as being a new mortgage borrower and you will receive 
 the following benefits: 
 
 
- Three 
 months FREE Unemployment and Disability cover equal to your monthly 
 benefit at the start of your policy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8 
 What 
 type of free cover does provide 
 for existing mortgage borrowers? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless 
 you qualify for exclusion free transfer; if the administrator receives 
 your completed application form and direct debit mandate more than 30 
 days after the completion date of your mortgage, you are classed as being 
 an existing mortgage borrower and you will receive:
 
 
- Three 
 months FREE Disability cover equal to your monthly benefit at the start 
 of your policy.
 
 
 
Unemployment 
 exclusion period: You will not be insured for any occurrence or notification 
 of impending unemployment which occurs within three calendar months of 
 the policy start date. If you have elected to take out unemployment cover, 
 this will only commence at the end of the FREE COVER period.
 
 Exclusion free transfer: If you are an existing mortgage borrower 
 and you transfer your unemployment and disability cover (or unemployment 
 only cover) from another insurer (other than Paymentshield) the exclusion 
 period will be waived and you will receive three months FREE Unemployment 
 and Disability cover. To qualify for exclusion free transfer you must 
 be able to prove that your existing policy has been in force for at least 
 six months and that you have not made a claim under that policy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9 
 What 
 is the maximum monthly cover you can take out under ? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 
 maximum monthly benefit you are allowed to insure under GOODMORTGAGEprotection 
 is £1,500 or 65% of your normal 
 income*, whichever is the lower (larger sums insured may be available 
 upon request).
 
 * If you are employed, normal income means the average 
 gross monthly income you received before deductions (or if weekly paid, 
 the monthly equivalent) in the past 12 months. If you are self employed, 
 normal income means the monthly average of your annual income as declared 
 on your Self Assessment Return for the previous tax year as confirmed 
 by the Inland Revenue. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10 
 Can 
 you take out unemployment only cover or disability only cover? 
 
 
 
 
 If 
 you do not need unemployment and disability cover, you can restrict your 
 insurance to either unemployment only cover or disability only cover. If 
 you do restrict your cover, you must be sure that you can meet your mortgage 
 payments whilst you are unable to work. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 11 
 What 
 is the cost of cover per £100.00 of monthly benefit? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The 
 cost of cover will depend on the level and type of cover you select under 
 GOODMORTGAGEprotection. 
 The appropriate premium rates (including Insurance Premium tax where applicable) 
 payable after three months FREE COVER period are detailed below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12 
 How 
 many people can be insured under ? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 
 number of people you can insure under GOODMORTGAGEprotection 
 will depend on whether your mortgage is in 
 single or joint names. Details of who can take out cover are provided 
 below:
 
 
- If 
 you are the only person named on your mortgage agreement, or you are 
 the only person named on your mortgage agreement who meets the eligibility 
 requirements of GOODMORTGAGEprotection, 
 cover will be issued solely in your name. In the event of a claim, you 
 will be insured for the full monthly benefit (this is known as single 
 cover).
 
- If 
 your mortgage agreement is in joint names and you both meet the eligibility 
 requirements of GOODMORTGAGEprotection, 
 you have the following options:
 
- you 
 can take out cover solely in your name provided that you are the main 
 income earner. In the event of a claim, you will be insured for the 
 full monthly benefit (this is known as single cover), or
 
- you 
 can split the cover between both of you (at no additional cost). In 
 the event of a claim, your monthly benefit will be divided in direct 
 proportion to the income of each party at the commencement date of the 
 claim (this is known as split cover), or
 
- you 
 can both be insured for the full monthly benefit. In the event of a 
 claim, you will be entitled to receive the full monthly benefit if either 
 of you makes a claim or double the monthly benefit if both of you make 
 a claim at the same time (this is known as joint cover). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13 
 What 
 happens if your monthly mortgage payment changes? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your 
 monthly benefit does not automatically change if the level of your mortgage 
 payment increases or decreases. It is therefore essential that you review 
 your monthly benefit on a regular basis to ensure that it meets your particular 
 requirements. 
 
 If your mortgage payment increases or decreases due to interest rate changes, 
 you can amend your monthly benefit without any penalty provided that you 
 notify the administrator within 30 days of any such change. Any other 
 type of amendment will be subject to a 90 day notice period. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14 
 What 
 should you do if your circumstances change? 
 
 
 
 
 
 These 
 are certain things you must tell the administrator about and they include 
 the following:
 
 
- 
 You 
 change your occupation, the type of work you do or your employment 
 status changes (as an example, from employed to self employed).
 
 
- 
 
 You begin working for less than 16 hours per week, or your normal 
 income is reduced.
 
 
- 
 You 
 become ineligible for cover. Where GOODMORTGAGEprotection 
 is issued in joint names, it may be possible to transfer the total 
 cover into the remaining name. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15 
 Are 
 there any circumstances when may 
 not be suitable for you? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There 
 are a number of circumstances which may affect your eligibility for cover, 
 or your entitlement to receive benefits under GOODMORTGAGEprotection. 
 Details of these are provided below:
 
 
- You 
 have not been continuously employed or self employed for the past six 
 months.
 
- You 
 are employed on a fixed term contract and you have been working for 
 your current employer for less than two years.
 
- You 
 have a fixed term contract of less than six months duration or your 
 current contract has less than six months to run.
 
- You 
 are self employed (particularly sole traders) and you are taking out 
 unemployment cover.
 
- You 
 have more than one job (including a mixture of employed and self employed 
 positions).
 
- You 
 have a pre-existing medical condition (see section 24).
 
- You 
 are an existing mortgage borrower and you are in arrears with your mortgage 
 payments.
 
- You 
 are acting as guarantor on a mortgage (even if you are named on the 
 mortgage agreement).
 
- You 
 hold any similar mortgage payment protection insurance with another 
 insurance provider.
 If any of the above circumstances apply to you, please attach the relevant 
 details to your application form. 
 
 
Important 
 note - The above circumstances do not mean that you will automatically 
 be excluded from taking out cover under GOODMORTGAGEprotection. 
 It may simply mean that some aspects of GOODMORTGAGEprotectionare 
 not suitable for you or that certain restrictions may apply. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 16 
 What 
 type of unemployment cover is provided under ? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There 
 are two specific circumstances when involuntary unemployment is deemed 
 to have occurred:
 
 
- Dismissed 
 - means your employment is terminated by your employer due to circumstances 
 which are entirely beyond your control, or
 
- Ceased 
 to trade - means the permanent total cessation of your business caused 
 by circumstances entirely beyond your control or the control of any 
 director, owner or partner in your business.
 
 
 
To 
 establish which of the above circumstances would apply to you, there are 
 a number of important factors that you will need to consider:
 
 
(a) 
 Whether you are employed or self employed:
 
 
- Employed 
 - you will be defined as being employed if you are in permanent employment 
 and your employer is deducting P.A.Y.E. Tax and National Insurance Contributions 
 on your behalf.
 
 
If 
 you are employed, you will usually be insured if you are dismissed 
 (see clause (b) for exceptions).
 
 
 
- Self 
 employed - you will be defined as being self employed if you are classed 
 for taxation purposes as Schedule D and you are required to make Class 
 2 National Insurance Contributions.
 
 
If 
 you are self employed, you will be insured if the business you work 
 in has ceased to trade.
 
 
 
 
(b) 
 Whether you are employed in a position that will affect your unemployment 
 cover: 
 
 
 
- Proprietor 
 - you will be defined as being a proprietor if you own, either alone 
 or in association with others (other than as a shareholder), the business 
 that you work in. 
 
If 
 you are a proprietor, you will only be insured if your business has 
 ceased to trade.
 
 
- Shareholding 
 director - you will be defined as being a shareholding director if you 
 are a company director or company secretary and you directly or indirectly 
 own more than 20% of the issued share capital of the business you that 
 work in. 
 
If 
 you are a shareholding director, you will only be insured if your 
 business has ceased to trade.
 
 
 
- Contract 
 worker - you will be defined as being a contract worker if you are employed 
 on a fixed term contract and you have not been employed by the same 
 employer for more than two years. If you are a contract worker, you 
 will not be insured against the non renewal of your fixed term contract 
 and any entitlement to claim benefits will cease on the date your contract 
 was originally intended to terminate.
 
 
 
(c) 
 Whether you are a relative* of a shareholding director or proprietor who 
 works in the same business as you.
 If you are a relative of a shareholding director or proprietor, you will 
 only be insured if the business that you work in has ceased to trade.
 
 * Relative means your husband, wife, co-habitee, or any 
 other immediate family member related to you by blood, marriage, or law. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 17 
 When 
 will you be able to make a claim for unemployment? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There 
 are certain requirements that you will need to meet before you can make 
 a claim for unemployment benefits under GOODMORTGAGEprotection. 
 Details of these are provided below:
 
 
- You 
 must have lost your job due to involuntary unemployment and be entirely 
 without work.
 
- You 
 must have paid all your premiums and continue to do so during any period 
 of claim (your monthly benefit will automatically be increased to reimburse 
 any premiums you have paid during the period of claim).
 
- You 
 must have been in continuous work for the six month period immediately 
 prior to your first unemployment claim. If you have not, then you must 
 have been in continuous work for the six month period immediately prior 
 to the policy start date.
 
- You 
 must have registered for Job Seekers Allowance (unless you are exempt) 
 at an Employment Office within the United Kingdom or equivalent in the 
 Channel Islands or Isle of Man. 
 
- You 
 must have agreed to comply with all the terms and conditions in respect 
 of qualification for State benefit payments.
 
- You 
 must be available for and actively seeking work and be able to provide 
 the administrator with evidence of this.
 
- You 
 must be prevented from attending work as a result of the unemployment 
 you are claiming for.
 
- You 
 must provide the administrator with all the evidence they require to 
 validate your claim.
 
 
The 
 underwriters will consider the first day of your unemployment to be the 
 day you are first registered for Job Seekers Allowance (unless you are 
 exempt) at an appropriate Employment Office within the United Kingdom 
 or equivalent in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man and are credited with 
 National Insurance Contributions. 
 
 You will not be considered as being unemployed during any period for which 
 you are in receipt of payment in Lieu of Notice* and the 30 day or 60 
 day excess period will not commence until the period of your payment in 
 lieu of notice has expired.
 
 * Payment in lieu of notice means any payment, or any compensation 
 for loss of office (including any payment made under a compromise agreement), 
 that directly or indirectly relates to any period of notice that has to 
 be given by you, or served by your employer, under the terms of your contract 
 of employment or letter of appointment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 18 
 Can 
 you suspend an unemployment claim for temporary work? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If 
 you are making a claim for unemployment and you are offered a temporary 
 job, you can suspend your claim provided that you tell the administrator 
 who you will be working for, how many hours a week you will be working 
 for and the duration of your temporary position.
 
 Important note - your temporary job must last for at least 
 one week and no longer than six months and you can not have more than 
 three separate temporary jobs during any one period of claim. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 19 
 When 
 will you be able to make a claim for disability? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There 
 are certain requirements that you will need to meet before you can make 
 a claim for disability benefits under GOODMORTGAGEprotection. 
 Details of these are provided below:
 
 
- You 
 must have paid all your premiums and continue to do so during any period 
 of claim (your monthly benefit will automatically be increased to reimburse 
 any premiums you have paid during the period of claim).
 
- You 
 must have been in continuous work when your disability occurred.
 
- You 
 must be under the regular care of a doctor or consultant for the disability 
 you are claiming for.
 
- You 
 must be prevented from attending work as a result of the disability 
 you are claiming for.
 
- You 
 must not be doing any other job for payment or reward.
 
- You 
 must provide the administrator with all the evidence they require to 
 validate your claim.
 
 
The 
 underwriters will consider the first day of your disability to be the 
 day a doctor or consultant first certifies that you are unable to work. 
 If you are self employed, you cannot be receiving any form of payment 
 for helping, managing or carrying out any part of the day-to-day running 
 of your business while you remain disabled. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 20 
 
 When do you receive claim payments? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This 
 will depend on the excess period you have selected as detailed below:
 
 30 day excess period - You will be entitled to receive 1/30th of the monthly 
 benefit for each day you remain continuously unemployed or disabled after 
 the 30 day excess period. The first monthly benefit payment will become 
 due on the 61st day.
 
 60 day excess period - You will be entitled to receive 1/30th of the monthly 
 benefit for each day you remain continuously unemployed or disabled after 
 the 60 day excess period. The first monthly benefit payment will become 
 due on the 91st day.
 
 Payments will continue monthly in arrears thereafter until the earliest 
 of the following events:
 
 
- The 
 last consecutive day that you remain unemployed or disabled.
 
- The 
 date you cease to provide evidence that you remain continuously unemployed 
 or disabled.
 
- The 
 date on which you have received 12 monthly benefit payments for any 
 separate period of claim.
 
- The 
 date on which GOODMORTGAGEprotection is 
 terminated (as detailed in section 28).
 
 
 
If 
 you take out unemployment and disability cover, you can transfer a claim 
 between unemployment and disability (or vice versa) provided you do not 
 exceed a combined total of 12 monthly benefit payments for any one period 
 of claim.
 
 Important note - If you restrict your insurance to unemployment 
 only cover or disability only cover, monthly benefit will only be payable 
 for a claim arising from the specific type of cover you have selected. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 21 
 What 
 happens if you need to make a claim? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If 
 you need to make a claim under GOODMORTGAGEprotection, 
 you should contact the administrator at the following address: Paymentshield 
 Limited, PO Box 229, Southport, PR9 9WU. Telephone: 0870-7594000. Facsimile: 
 0870-7594001. They will send you a claim form. 
 
 To enable the administrator to process and validate your claim, there 
 are certain things you will have to do. Details of these are provided 
 below:
 
 
- You 
 must complete and return the claim form as soon as possible and provide 
 the administrator with any further evidence they may require.
 
- In 
 the event of unemployment, you must provide the administrator with evidence 
 that you remain continuously unemployed and actively seeking work.
 
- In 
 the event of disability, you must provide the administrator with evidence 
 that you remain continuously disabled and under the regular care and 
 attention of a doctor or consultant.
 
- You 
 must attend an independent medical examination if this is required to 
 validate your claim (the underwriters will pay the cost of any such 
 examination).
 
 
Important 
 note - If you fail or refuse to attend a medical examination and you do 
 not provide a satisfactory reason, the underwriters will not pay any monthly 
 benefit.
 
 
- You 
 must pay the cost of obtaining any evidence the administrator may reasonably 
 require.
 
 
 
The 
 administrator can contact your current or past employers, doctor, consultant, 
 Inland Revenue, Department for Employment and Education (or similar bodies 
 as appropriate) or any other person, company or organisation as deemed 
 necessary to validate your claim. The administrator also reserves the 
 right to request sight of your personal bank or financial statements.
 
 If you are making a claim for unemployment, the administrator (or their 
 agents) may, at their discretion, arrange to conduct a personal interview 
 with you to assist you in actively seeking further permanent employment.
 
 All claim payments will be made monthly in arrears. The administrator 
 will only commence the payment of monthly benefit when they have received 
 full and satisfactory evidence of your eligibility to claim.
 
 Important note - Any delay in submitting a claim form or 
 any further evidence could make your claim harder to validate and lead 
 to the late payment or denial of any monthly benefit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 22 
 Are 
 there circumstances when claim payments may be reduced? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 
 the event of a claim, the underwriters will deduct from your monthly benefit 
 any amount which exceeds 65% of your normal income. 
 
 If you hold any similar insurance cover in respect of your mortgage, the 
 underwriters also reserve the right to reduce your monthly benefit under 
 GOODMORTGAGEprotection by 
 an amount equal to the monthly benefit payable to you under any other 
 such insurance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 23 
 Can 
 you make more than one claim under ? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You 
 can make more than one claim subject to the requalification periods detailed 
 below:
 
 
- Requalification 
 after a partial claim - If you received less than 12 monthly benefit 
 payments for a previous claim, you will need to be in continuous work 
 for a period of at least 90 days before you can make a new claim. If 
 two claims are separated by less than 90 consecutive days of work, they 
 will be treated as the same claim and you will be entitled to receive 
 the balance of any monthly benefit remaining from the previous claim.
