Do you use computers, do you play an instrument? Does your career, your progress, depend on using your eyes and hands? £150,000 tax-free lump sum is payable if, through an accident, you lose permanently the sight in one or both eyes, or the use of one or both hands. The money may be used for essential re-training, or to provide an income, or in any way you choose. Young people are particularly vulnerable, being so much dependant upon computers at school, college and in the earlier years at work. Sporting, playground and motor accidents are all included.

Applications to insure a minor need additional information (to be completed during checkout). Milo gives 24-hour cover, worldwide, available only to those who are normally resident in the UK (if you are not in this category, please write with more details - we may be able to cover you).
