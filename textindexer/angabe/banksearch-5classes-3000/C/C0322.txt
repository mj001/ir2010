 Membership is subject to acceptance of your application by BUPA, the rules 
 and table of benefits of the scheme and any special conditions that may 
 apply. Full details of general terms and conditions are available on request 
 and will be sent to you when you join. Precise terms of cover available 
 will depend on an assessment of your individual circumstances. 
 
 Local HospitalCare 
 offers lower cost private medical cover at a network of around 180 specially 
 selected BUPA partnership network hospitals. All that&#146;s excluded 
 is the cost of seeing a consultant privately before you go into hospital 
 (which you can do via your GP). This enables costs to be kept down, without 
 the quality of care you receive in hospital being compromised.

 cover for eligible treatment: 
 
 
- At one 
 of BUPA's partnership network hospitals
 
- For private 
 day-case and in-patient treatment
 
- For out-patient
