 This policy provides all risks insurance for your photographic and video 
 equipment. The policy is underwritten by Cedar Insurance Company Limited.
 
Insurance 
 is provided on a new for old basis, ie if your equipment is lost or 
 stolen, you will receive a sum allowing you to replace it with the same 
 or equivalent models. This policy also provides personal liability cover 
 of up to £500,000 if you should injure someone while using cameras 
 or video recorders
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This policy covers all risks of accidental loss or damage to your equipment. 
 Cover is on a worldwide basis, although longer visits abroad must be notified 
 in advance &#150; see Policy Details. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The insurance does not cover normal wear and tear of your equipment or 
 loss if you leave it in an unattended vehicle. Damage to films is also 
 excluded. 
 
If 
 you share accommodation (or if it is not self-contained) loss by theft 
 will normally be excluded, unless there is evidence of forced entry 
 to the premises. 
 
The 
 first £12.50 of every claim under £500 is excluded and there 
 is a sliding scale of excess for larger claims - see Policy Details.
