Placing and Open Offer to raise £20.2m 
 and other proposals
 Unaudited loss estimate and dividend forecast for year ended 31 
 December 2000 
 
 
Chaucer Holdings PLC (&#147;Chaucer&#148; or &#147;the Company&#148;) 
 announces that it is proposing to raise approximately £20.2 
 million (before expenses) by means of a Placing and Open Offer of 
 33,619,489 new Chaucer shares (&#147;Offer Shares&#148;) at 60p 
 per share. Chaucer has also entered into a conditional agreement 
 with BRIT Insurance Holdings PLC (&#147;BRIT&#148;) for the acquisition 
 (&#147;the Acquisition&#148;) of BRIT's interest in Chaucer Dedicated 
 Limited (&#147;CDL&#148;), an associated company of Chaucer, for 
 an approximate consideration of £3.4 million to be satisfied 
 by the issue to BRIT of 5,650,000 Consideration Shares at 60p per 
 share. A prospectus, incorporating a notice of an extraordinary 
 general meeting (&#147;EGM&#148;) to be held on 2 April 2001 to 
 seek shareholder approval, is being posted to shareholders today.
 
Placing and Open Offer
 
Under the terms of the Open Offer, shareholders on the register 
 at 2 March 2001 (excluding overseas shareholders) (&#147;Qualifying 
 Shareholders&#148;) may apply for the Offer Shares at 60p per share 
 pro rata to their existing shareholdings, on the basis of
 
 3 Offer Shares for every 4 existing Chaucer Shares
 
held at the close of business on 2 March 2001 (and so in proportion 
 for any greater or smaller number of existing Chaucer Shares then 
 held). The amount due in respect of each application for Offer Shares 
 is payable in full on application. Entitlements to Offer Shares 
 will be rounded down to the nearest whole Offer Share. Fractional 
 entitlements will not be allotted and will be disregarded.
 
Certain Directors and two existing Shareholders have irrevocably 
 undertaken or otherwise agreed to apply for some or all of their 
 entitlements to Offer Shares under the Open Offer. Such commitments 
 relate to 5,127,023, or 15.3 per cent, of the Offer Shares. The 
 balance of 28,492,466, or 84.7 per cent, of the Offer Shares has 
 been conditionally placed by Numis Securities Limited (&#147;Numis&#148;) 
 with certain institutions and certain existing shareholders at the 
 Offer Price subject to the rights of Qualifying Shareholders to 
 apply to take up the Offer Shares under the Open Offer (&#147;the 
 Placing&#148;). 
 
The Offer Shares will be issued credited as fully paid and will 
 rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Chaucer shares 
 save that they will not rank for the final dividend for the 12 months 
 ended 31 December 2000.
 
 The Placing and Open Offer is conditional, inter alia, on:
 
 
 (i) 
 the passing of resolutions at the 
 EGM by the Chaucer shareholders to approve the implementation 
 of the Placing and Open Offer; 
 
 
 (ii) 
 the placing agreement relating to 
 the Placing and Open Offer becoming unconditional and not having 
 been terminated; and 
 
 
 (iii)
 
 Admission to the Official List and 
 to trading on the London Stock Exchange (&#147;Admission&#148;) 
 of the Offer Shares becoming effective by no later than 8.00 
 a.m. on 3 April 2001 (or such later time and date, being no 
 later than 9.00 a.m. on 10 April 2001, as the Company and Numis 
 may agree).It is expected that Admission of the Offer Shares 
 will become effective and that dealings in the Offer Shares 
 will commence on 3 April 2001. 
 
 
 
The Directors intend that at least £14 million of the net 
 proceeds of the Placing and Open Offer will be applied in providing 
 funds at Lloyd's to support the Group's underwriting on the Chaucer 
 Syndicates for the 2002 and subsequent years of account. Additionally, 
 up to £4.5 million will be applied in providing additional 
 working capital to fund underwriting losses, including the share 
 of CDL losses assumed as a result of the Acquisition.
 
In particular, the Company anticipates that the Chaucer Group will 
 require additional funds to support underwriting capacity on Syndicates 
 587 and 1096 for the 2002 year of account which it may acquire pursuant 
 to mandatory offers which the Group is required to make under Lloyd&#146;s 
 rules to the remaining members of Syndicates 587 and 1096. On the 
 basis of the Chaucer Group&#146;s current solvency ratio of 40 per 
 cent, Chaucer would require £17.9 million of additional capital 
 to support all the outstanding underwriting capacity on these Syndicates 
 which the Group and CDL does not presently own. However, the amount 
 of capacity which the Group actually acquires pursuant to the mandatory 
 offers will depend upon the prices offered and the willingness of 
 the remaining syndicate members to sell their capacity. Chaucer 
 anticipates that it will also use further amounts of the net proceeds 
 of the Placing and Open Offer to support the Chaucer Group&#146;s 
 shares of planned increases in the stamp capacities of Syndicates 
 587, 1084 and 1096 (&#147;the Chaucer Syndicates&#148;) for the 
 2002 year of account.
 
To the extent not utilised in the manner described in the preceding 
 paragraph, the Company intends to apply the net proceeds in or towards 
 replacing two reinsurance gearing policies which currently provide 
 £12.5 million of funds at Lloyd's on behalf of the Group.
 
If, as a result of the mandatory offers or otherwise, the Chaucer 
 Group were to acquire more capacity on the Chaucer Syndicates than 
 it is able to underwrite with its own funds, the Group would seek 
 alternative funding arrangements for this surplus capacity or, in 
 the absence of such funding, could choose not to underwrite the 
 surplus.
 
Acquisition of BRIT's interest in Chaucer Dedicated Limited
 
Chaucer has also agreed to acquire BRIT's entire interest in CDL 
 (including BRIT's participation in the open 1998, 1999, 2000 and 
 2001 years of account) for an approximate consideration of £3.4 
 million which will be satisfied by the issue to BRIT of 5,650,000 
 new Chaucer shares (&#147;Consideration Shares&#148;) at 60p per 
 share.
 
The Consideration Shares to be issued in respect of the Acquisition 
 will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Chaucer Shares 
 save that they will not rank for the final dividend for the 12 months 
 ended 31 December 2000. It is expected that Admission of the Consideration 
 Shares will become effective and that dealings in the Consideration 
 Shares will commence on the next dealing day after the date on which 
 the Acquisition is completed.
 
As a result of the Acquisition, CDL will retain £3.8 million 
 of funds at Lloyd's currently loaned by BRIT and net assets as at 
 31 December 1999 (adjusted, inter alia, for loss provisions already 
 made in respect of the 1998 and 1999 years of account) of approximately 
 £0.3 million. CDL will also retain capacity rights costing 
 approximately £0.3 million which were funded by loans from 
 BRIT. For the year ended 31 December 1999, CDL reported a loss, 
 before tax, of £3.6 million of which BRIT&#146;s share was 
 £0.8 million. No audited accounts are available for CDL in 
 respect of any later period.
 
Following the Acquisition, Chaucer will assume responsibility for 
 losses in respect of the 1998 and 1999 years of account attributable 
 to BRIT's interest. However, Chaucer receives, inter alia, the benefit 
 of the future tax relief expected by the Chaucer Group in respect 
 of such losses, payments already made by BRIT in respect of 1998 
 year of account losses and accrued interest on funds at Lloyd&#146;s 
 due to BRIT. Any profit or loss in respect of BRIT's participation 
 in CDL for the 2000 or 2001 year of account will also accrue to 
 Chaucer.
 
Following the Acquisition, CDL (which is currently treated as a 
 joint venture of the Chaucer Group for accounting purposes) will 
 become consolidated in the Chaucer Group's accounts.
 
The Acquisition is conditional, inter alia, upon shareholders' 
 approval which will be sought at the EGM, the Placing Agreement 
 becoming unconditional in accordance with its terms and Lloyd's 
 approval to the change of control of CDL. Shareholders' approval 
 for the Acquisition is required because BRIT is deemed by the Listing 
 Rules of the UK Listing Authority to be a related party to Chaucer 
 by reason of its holding of 11,886,466 Chaucer shares which constitutes 
 26.52 per cent of Chaucer's existing issued share capital.
 
Following completion of the Acquisition and the Placing and Open 
 Offer, BRIT's shareholding in Chaucer will be a maximum of 26.8 
 per cent. In view of BRIT&#146;s shareholding in Chaucer and its 
 position as a related party of Chaucer, BRIT has undertaken not 
 to vote at the EGM on the resolution to approve the Acquisition.

Basic loss per share has been calculated on the loss after tax 
 and a weighted average number of shares in issue during the year 
 of 44.5 million (1999: 44.3 million).
 
The estimate includes provisions for underwriting losses of £2.3 
 million. These are principally provisions which the Directors consider 
 are appropriate, as a matter of prudence, in respect of the Group's 
 underwriting for the 2000 year of account and in respect of any 
 deterioration on the syndicates remaining open from the 1996 and 
 1997 years of account. It is to be emphasised that, in making the 
 provisions, no estimate or projection is being made or is to be 
 implied as to the ultimate outcome of the Group's underwriting for 
 the 2000 year of account.
 
The unaudited loss estimate of £2.8 million in respect of 
 investment losses for the year represents £1.4 million of 
 realised investment losses and £1.4 million unrealised losses 
 attributable to a fall in the market value of the Group's investments 
 at the year end. The realised investment losses arose as a result 
 of the sale of the Company's holding in Aberdeen UK Growth Unit 
 Trust which was referred to in the Company's interim statement for 
 the six months ended 30 June 2000. Since the year end, the Group's 
 investment portfolio has recovered to a significant extent, thereby 
 significantly reducing the unrealised losses reflected in the Group's 
 loss estimate for the year ended 31 December 2000.
 
In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the Directors intend 
 to recommend a final dividend of 1.0p per Chaucer Share (1999: 1.0p) 
 giving a total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2000 of 1.5p 
 per Chaucer Share (1999: 2.0p).
 
Current Trading and Prospects
 
The Company reported in its interim statement for the six months 
 ended 30 June 2000 that rates had improved in the motor market since 
 the end of 1998. Rates have continued to increase in the private 
 car and fleet business throughout the year 2000. There is evidence 
 that further rate increases in that business have been experienced 
 by the Chaucer Group during the current year although these increases 
 have to be viewed in the context of an expected increase in claims 
 costs and personal injury awards.
 
The Company also reported in its interim statement that it was 
 seeing evidence of hardening rates in selective areas of the marine, 
 aviation and non-marine markets in which the Group operates. Rates 
 in both those and certain other areas in which the Group operates 
 have continued to harden during the remainder of 2000 and the beginning 
 of this year. These markets, however, remain uneven and it is too 
 early to report rate increases across all areas of the Group's business.
 
In light of the above, the Board is cautiously optimistic of the 
 prospects of the Chaucer Group (as enlarged by the Acquisition) 
 for the current year.
 
Background 
 
Chaucer is one of a number of quoted Lloyd's integrated vehicles 
 which have evolved in recent years. Integrated Lloyd's vehicles 
 now tend to trade at a premium to their net tangible asset values 
 and although this premium has narrowed in many cases (and in some 
 instances reverted to a discount), the share prices of most of the 
 quoted Lloyd's integrated vehicles are now beginning to recover 
 as the market perceives an upswing in the underwriting cycle.
 
The managed capacity of the Chaucer Syndicates is now £256.4 
 million spread across the motor, non-marine and marine sectors of 
 the Lloyd's market. All of the underwriting capacity now owned by 
 the Chaucer Group is devoted to the Chaucer Syndicates.
 
Chaucer underwrites through its wholly-owned subsidiary ALIT (No.1) 
 Limited (&#147;ALIT&#148;) and through CDL, which have gross underwriting 
 capacities for the 2001 year of account of £103.3 million 
 and £60 million respectively. Of ALIT's funds at Lloyd's for 
 the 2001 year of account, £14 million is provided through 
 two quota share reinsurance policies which provide £35 million 
 of underwriting capacity for the 2001 year of account and a further 
 £5 million is provided pursuant to a reinsurance gearing contract.
 
Various arrangements have also been entered into with third party 
 shareholders in CDL for the provision of CDL's funds at Lloyd's 
 for the 2001 and prior years of account. Broadly stated, the Company 
 currently has an approximate 47 per cent interest in the 2001 year 
 of account results of CDL. Furthermore £7.5 million of CDL&#146;s 
 funds at Lloyd&#146;s is provided pursuant to a reinsurance gearing 
 contract.
 
Underwriting Capacity
 
 As a result of its interests in ALIT and CDL, the Chaucer Group 
 has an economic interest in £96.3 million of underwriting 
 capacity on the Chaucer Syndicates for the 2001 year of account, 
 representing approximately 37.6 per cent of the aggregate capacity 
 managed by CSL as set out below:

Employee Share Schemes
 
The Company is proposing to adopt a new all-employee share scheme 
 (AESOP) under the Finance Act 2000 and a new Inland Revenue Approved 
 Share Option Scheme. The Company is also seeking to make certain 
 amendments to the Company&#146;s Unapproved Share Option and Savings 
 Related Schemes.
 
The Company further proposes that 1,365,000 options granted under 
 the existing Unapproved Share Option Scheme and exercisable at 135p 
 or 100p per share will be cancelled (subject to agreement with the 
 individual holders).
 
Warrants
 
Following completion of the Placing and Open Offer the exercise 
 prices of the Company&#146;s 1998 Warrants and the Company&#146;s 
 1993 Warrants will be adjusted: from 135p (currently) to 132p per 
 share for the 1998 Warrants and from 100p (currently) to 98p per 
 share for the 1993 Warrants. In addition, a total of 122,362 new 
 1993 Warrants and 64,773 new 1998 Warrants will, subject to Admission, 
 be issued to existing Warrantholders pro-rata to their existing 
 holdings of 1993 or 1998 Warrants (as the case may be).
 
Extraordinary General Meeting
 
An Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company has been convened 
 for 2 April 2001 for the purpose of considering and, if thought 
 fit, passing the requisite resolutions, inter alia, to approve and 
 implement the Placing and Open Offer and the Acquisition.
