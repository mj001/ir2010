 GISC
 consultation - BIBA response
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GISC
 Reference
 
 
 
 
 
1
 
 
 
As
 a trade association representing
 insurance brokers and independent
 insurance intermediaries, BIBA
 strongly advocates the
 differentiation of its members from
 others engaged in selling general
 insurance. BIBA does not, however,
 promote protectionism and welcomes
 the opportunity offered by the
 introduction of a new regulatory
 regime to build on the standards to
 which its members are committed.
 BIBA agrees the fundamental
 principles on which the proposed
 GISC regime is based.

BIBA
 has consulted widely with its
 membership and has sought responses
 to the Consultation document from
 its Board, Regional Committees and
 from individual members. A number of
 common issues have been highlighted
 by these responses, copies of which
 have already been furnished to GISC.
 
 
 
 
 
 
3
 
 
 
Whilst
 GISC proposes to regulate all those
 involved in the sale and
 administration of general insurance,
 there are third party organisations
 such as loss adjusters and claims
 outsourcing companies also providing
 services to GISC member clients.
 Discussions should take place with
 appropriate representative bodies
 (such as the Chartered Institute of
 Loss Adjusters) to ensure that
 regulation is as seamless as
 possible. Specific reference should
 be made to the continuing
 impartiality of loss adjusters and
 their relationships with insurers
 whose activities would otherwise be
 regulated by GISC.
 
 
 
1.4
 
 
 
 
 
4
 
 
 
BIBA
 suggests that the definition of
 general insurance should be amended
 to ‘all business not regulated by
 the Financial Services Authority’.
 This would at present include, for
 example, PMI and PHI insurances.
 
 
 
1.4
 
 
 
 
 
5
 
 
 
It
 is essential that GISC membership
 should be a requirement for all
 insurers/underwriters so that the
 same level of regulation applies
 across the whole industry, including
 ‘broker-only’ insurers.
 
 
 
1.5
 
 
 
 
 
6
 
 
 
Brokers
 have expressed concern about the
 make up of the future GISC Board.
 How does GISC propose to ensure that
 the new body is democratic, has a
 sensible balance including broker
 representation and that the Board is
 not dominated by any single interest
 group? What are the proposed terms
 of office?
 
 
 
2.4
 
 
 
 
 
7
 
 
 
How
 will the public interest group
 representatives be chosen?
 
 
 
2.5
 
 
 
 
 
8
 
 
 
BIBA
 supports the proposed timetable for
 the introduction of firms in to GISC
 membership. It is important that the
 number of regulated firms grows in a
 sensible and orderly fashion to
 avoid the chaos which would result
 if unmanageable numbers of firms
 were to join from the outset.
 
 
 
3.1
 
3.2
 
3.3
 
 
 
 
 
9
 
 
 
How
 will GISC guarantee orderly transfer
 of insurance brokers currently
 regulated by IBRC? What will happen
 to insurance brokers if GISC is
 unable to meet its own timetable?
 
 
 
3.1
 
3.2
 
3.3
 
 
 
 10 
 The
 Consultation document does not
 contain specific timescales for many
 of the changes and developments in
 the regime which are anticipated.
 These should be put in to place and
 prioritised. 
 
 
3.2
 
 
 
 11 
 There
 are serious concerns about the
 ability of GISC to commence its
 operations without the existence of
 a complete rulebook. Many firms will
 find it impossible to comply with
 Practice Requirements which have not
 been published at the time that the
 regulator begins to operate. 
 
 
4
 
 
 
 12 
 Will
 the regime differentiate between
 personal lines and commercial lines
 and other customers in applying its
 fundamental principles? If so, how
 will this be done? 
 
 
4
 
 
 
 13 
 Many
 BIBA members have expressed in the
 strongest terms their view that
 insurance brokers should be very
 clearly differentiated from other
 regulated firms under the GISC
 rules. GISC should reserve the use
 of the term ‘insurance broker’
 to those who adhere to higher
 standards than the GISC minimum
 rules. 
 
 
4.19
 
 
 
 14 
 13
 above is reflected by the failure of
 the draft code adequately to explain
 broker differentiation. The Practice
 Requirements must clearly define the
 difference between each category of
 member in the interest of the
 consumer. 
 
 
4.19
 
 
 
 15 
 The
 Consultation document suggests that
 all regulated firms should declare
 their membership of GISC and/or
 their status. How precisely should
 this be done? 
 
 
4.3.2
 
 
 
 16 
 Where
 an explanation of the insurance
 contract is required, there must be
 a provision to ensure that this is
 done only once by one of the
 regulated firms during the sales
 process. This is essential to avoid
 duplication. 
 
 
4.3.4
 
 
 
 17 
 The
 proposal to require brokers to
 forward claims information within 3
 working days of receipt is
 unworkable. A more sensible approach
 would be to require this ‘without
 undue delay’, or ‘in accordance
 with policy terms and conditions’
 as a minimum. 
 
 
4.3.6
 
 
 
 18 
 Paid
 Introducers or Sub-Agents may act in
 this capacity for a multiplicity of
 principals. There appears to be a
 serious gap in the provisions of the
 Code in this respect. The ultimate
 customer may find that none of a
 variety of principals is willing to
 accept responsibility for the
 actions of an Introducer. 
 
 
4.3.10
 
 
 
 19 
 
 
The
 disclosure of commission and fees
 requirements should not be applied
 to non-insurance products. The
 regulatory regime is designed to
 apply to general insurance, and not
 to other products or services.
 
 
 
4.3.12
 
 
 
 20 
 
 
Why
 is there a separate and additional
 requirement for the provision of
 monthly accounts for insurance
 brokers and Lloyds brokers? If this
 is to continue, a deadline should be
 agreed for its introduction for all
 other member firms.
 
 
 
5.3
 
 
 
 21 
 
 
The
 requirement for a P.I. indemnity
 limit of a minimum 4 times income is
 excessive. We suggest a minimum of 2
 times income, subject to an overall
 minimum of £1,000,000 each and
 every loss.
 
 
 
5.3.B.5
 
 
 
 22 
 The
 proposed definitions of solvency and
 capital adequacy, which compare
 current assets with total
 liabilities are not acceptable. Many
 small firms will find a requirement
 for a solvency margin of at least £5000
 unattainable. 
 
 
5.3.C
 
 
 
 23 
 
 
GISC
 is proposing to require each member
 firm to submit audited accounts.
 This goes beyond current company law
 and accounting practice and is not
 at present a requirement for many
 firms.
 
As a
 minimum, such a requirement should
 be phased in over a period of years,
 particularly for new firms entering
 the general insurance business.
 
Provisions
 should be made to allow a time
 margin for compliance where firms
 may suffer temporary non-compliance.
 
 5.3.D 
 
 
 24 
 
 
The
 provisions in respect of compliance,
 monitoring and discipline must
 reflect the size, complexity and
 market segments in which regulated
 firms operate. Brokers must be
 confident that these rules will be
 applied equally to each regulated
 firm irrespective of size.
 
 
 
5.3.D
 
 
 
 25 
 
 
The
 definitions of the terms
 ‘earned’ or ‘received’ must
 be clarified. Can GISC give an
 indication of the timescale during
 which any change is to be
 introduced?
 
 
 
5.3.5
 
 
 
 26 
 
 
The
 proposal that each member firm will
 receive a compliance monitoring
 visit at least once every four years
 is likely to generate enormous
 costs. Have these now been
 calculated? How are they to be
 funded? What is the cost implication
 for each regulated firm? How can
 such a monitoring system be
 justified when professional firms in
 other sectors (e.g. lawyers and
 chartered accountants) do not
 require this?
 
 
 
6.1
 
 
 
 27 
 
 
Monitoring
 should be carried out by individuals
 and organisations who understand the
 general insurance business.
 Monitoring should not be carried out
 by accountants, particularly bearing
 in mind the requirement for all
 regulated firms to submit audited
 accounts. A variety of monitors
 would be helpful although every
 effort must be made to ensure
 consistency of approach.
 
 
 
6.1
 
 
 
 28 
 
 
Any
 enforcement or disciplinary
 committee should be representative
 of both the industry and the
 consumer.
 
 
 
7
 
 
 
 29 
 
 
Will
 disciplinary procedures be applied
 to individuals as well as to
 corporate entities?
 
 
 
7
 
 
 
 30 
 
 
The
 Continuing Professional Development
 requirement should be enhanced to a
 minimum of 20 hours per annum for
 all insurance brokers, assuming that
 differentiation is maintained.
 
 
 
8.4
 
 
 
 31 
 
 
‘Grandfathering’
 provisions should also be applied to
 employees of IBRC registered firms
 who have been employed for, say, a
 minimum of 6 years, to fall in line
 with the provision in respect of
 employees of firms regulated under
 the ABI Codes and others.
 
 
 
8.5
 
 
 
 32 
 
 
The
 proposal to charge a £500 fee in
 respect of every complaint made to
 the Ombudsman is unacceptable. This
 encourages customers to make trivial
 or vexatious complaints. BIBA
 suggests that customers should be
 asked to make a contribution in
 respect of each complaint and the
 system should operate on the basis
 that fees are returned to the
 successful party. Alternatively, a
 levy should be considered to apply
 across the regulated community in
 order to fund the costs of a
 complaints handling mechanism.
 
 
 
9.1
 
 
 
 33 
 
 
The
 original Consultation document
 suggested that an arbitration or
 alternate dispute resolution system
 would be considered in respect of
 commercial business. Is this option
 to be pursued?
 
 
 
9.1
 
9.2
 
 
 
 34 
 
 
The
 proposals with regard to an interim
 complaints system should be
 clarified, as should the proposed
 timescale
 
 
 
9.2
 
 
 
 35 
 
 
GISC
 is suggesting that all membership
 subscriptions should be paid
 annually in advance. Many similar
 organisations now offer their
 members a facility by which
 subscriptions may be paid monthly by
 direct debit. This should be offered
 to all regulated firms.
 
 
 
10.2.4
 
 
 
 36 
 
 
GISC
 must reaffirm its commitment to a
 system of accountability and
 scrutiny which is fair and
 effective.
