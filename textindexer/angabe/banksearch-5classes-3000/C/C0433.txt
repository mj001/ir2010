Syndicate Forecasts and Current Trading
 
The 
 Directors of Chaucer Holdings PLC announce initial syndicate forecasts 
 for the 2000 year of account and updated forecasts for the 1999 
 year of account based on statistics as at 30 June 2001.  The 2000 
 forecasts confirm an improving trend across all managed syndicates.  
 Rates are continuing to harden in all major parts of the Group’s 
 business and prospects for 2002 are good.  Syndicate 1096 has 
 strengthened reserves in respect of US casualty business but is 
 unaffected by US Directors and Officers insurance which it reduced 
 to minimal levels from the 1999 year and only had low exposure 
 prior to that.
 
Forecast 
 results in respect of the 2000 year of account are shown below.

The forecasts 
 are net of standard personal expenses at managing agent’s level 
 (ie after annual subscriptions, levies and managing agents’ fees 
 and commissions but before members’ agents’ charges).  The forecasts 
 are made subject to the usual caveats that apply to Lloyd’s syndicate 
 forecasts and are based on information prepared for the 30 June 
 2001 Syndicate Returns.

The pre-emptions in respect of syndicates 587, 1084 
 and 1096 have been approved by the Lloyd’s Authorisations Committee.
 
* Syndicate 3210’s current capacity for 2001 is 
 £50 million.  The syndicate has applied for a further pre-emption 
 for 2001 to £88 million and intends to increase this to £156 million 
 for 2002.
 
Capacity Offers
 
ALIT (No. 1) Limited, the wholly-owned corporate 
 member of Chaucer Holdings PLC, is to make announced auction offers 
 in the first Lloyd’s auction this September to acquire all of 
 the prospective participations on syndicates 587 and 1096 for 
 the 2002 year of account other than those to which it and its 
 associates are already entitled.  The offer prices will be 0.1p 
 per £1 in respect of £23.5 million of capacity on syndicate 587 
 and 1.5p per £1 in respect of £6.9 million of capacity on syndicate 
 1096.  In order to buy-out non-accepting holders of capacity in 
 each respective syndicate, Chaucer would need Lloyd’s approval 
 and to purchase 57.5% of syndicate 587 capacity for which the 
 offer is made and 50% in respect of syndicate 1096.
