Our 
 Group Annual Travel Insurance gives you and your employees automatic 
 insurance cover for business trips abroad.
 
The 
 cover is designed for non-manual, clerical and managerial roles. 
 
 
Holidays 
 are also covered and even trips combining business and holiday.
 
Medical 
 expenses, cancellation, delay and personal liability covers are 
 all included.
 
You 
 can add cover for luggage, personal effects, money and business 
 samples if you do not have these insured elsewhere.
 
 Our 
 24 hour helplines offer emergency medical assistance from anywhere 
 in the world and you also have access to legal and claims advice 
 lines. 
 
This 
 insurance is arranged with 
 certain syndicates at Lloyds .
