	Cover for Death and Veterinary Fees is limited to claims arising from injury only in the first 14 days of your policy. We will not pay any claims arising from 
	illness contracted within 14 days of the start of cover. All policies are subject to any special conditions or exclusions made by the insurers. 
	
	You will be invited to renew your policy each year. Our policies are annual contracts and the terms, conditions, premiums and excesses may change each year. 
	
	We will store your details on computer to administer your policy but we will not keep them any longer than necessary.

	Our Guarantee 
	
	
	
	Please read the insurance Certificate and policy wording. If after considering them, you are not happy and have not made a claim, you have 14 days after you 
	receive them during which you can cancel the policy and receive a full refund of any money paid.
