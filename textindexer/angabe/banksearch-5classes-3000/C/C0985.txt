10. When the policy pays out for unemployment
 
 Subject to the exclusions detailed in section 11, we will 
 pay out for unemployment if:
 
 
 
- you are unemployed and you are registered as available 
 for work (unless you are exempt) at an employment office 
 (or equivalent) in the UK; and
 
- you can provide independent evidence that you are actively 
 looking for permanent work.
 
 
 
We will consider the first day of your unemployment to 
 be the day you are first registered as unemployed and available 
 for work (unless you are exempt) at an employment office 
 (or equivalent) in the UK and receiving the appropriate 
 national insurance credits. If you are receiving payment 
 in lieu of notice the waiting period will not begin until 
 your payment in lieu of notice period has ended.
