 There are two ways you can use our website to find the BIBA member that will most suit your needs &#150; either based on where you live, or what it is you have to insure.
 
 If you&#146;re looking for home, contents, motor or travel
 insurance, then you probably need to find a broker conveniently near to where you live. In this case, just type the name of your county, unitary authority or nearest town in the box below.
 
 On the other hand, if your needs are a bit more out of the
 ordinary, you&#146;ll need a specialist BIBA broker. There are over 350 different types of insurance available, ranging from antiques to musical instruments, from pets to yachts, and covering every type of business insurance. Use the OTHER TYPES OF INSURANCE box below to find the insurance you need.
