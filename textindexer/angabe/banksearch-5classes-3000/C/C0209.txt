How 
 your DIRECT DEBIT Instruction works
 Direct 
 Debit is one of the safest and simplest ways to make regular payments because 
 there is no danger of missing a payment or of cheques being delayed. Your 
 Bank or Building Society simply transfers the amount due from your account 
 automatically. 
 
When we receive your 
 Direct Debit Instruction we forward the form to your Bank or Building Society 
 and they arrange for your payments to be made. Your policy document will 
 show the start date of your policy and your premium payments will be collected 
 on or immediately after the date your policy started and then, for monthly 
 instalments at the same time each month. 
 The 
 Direct Debit Guarantee
 This 
 Guarantee is offered by all Banks and Building Societies that take part in 
 the Direct Debit Scheme. The efficiency and security of the Scheme is monitored 
 and protected by your own Bank or Building Society.
 If the amounts 
 to be paid or the payment dates change, POIS Member Services Ltd will notify 
 you 10 working days in advance of your account being debited or as otherwise 
 agreed. If an error is made by POIS Member Services Ltd or your Bank or Building 
 Society, you are guaranteed a full and immediate refund from your branch of 
 the amount paid.
 You can cancel 
 a Direct Debit at any time by writing to your Bank or Building Society. Please 
 also send a copy of your letter to us.
