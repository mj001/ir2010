 The 
 Guardian name was established in 1821. Originally Guardian 
 Fire & Life, the Company was renamed as Guardian Assurance 
 in 1902. 
 
In the mid 1960's, Guardian Assurance established a 
 new base at Lytham St Annes in Lancashire for its expanding 
 Life and Pensions business.
 
In 1968 the company merged with Royal Exchange Assurance 
 to form the Guardian Royal Exchange Group (GRE).
 
In 1999, the Life and Pensions business of GRE (which 
 included Guardian Financial Services) along with the 
 Guardian name was acquired by AEGON 
 UK part of the global 
 AEGON N.V. group.
 
Today, 
 as Guardian Financial Services, over 800 staff 
 continue to provide a service to over a million customers 
 from our Head Office in Lytham St Annes.
