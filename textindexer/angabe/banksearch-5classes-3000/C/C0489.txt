	Research recently commissioned by Royal & SunAlliance (R&SA) and the International Stress Management AssociationUK (ISMAUK) reveals that 44% of adults in the UK find being in rush hour traffic the most stressful situation. 
Surprisingly, the issue of children&#8217;s future came in at second place (32%) closely followed by work (31%). Whilst new technology, which is often seen as a great stress creator, does not feature very highly at all &#8211; coming in at eighth place (21%). More/&#8230; Stress&#8230;2 The Top Ten Most Stressful Activities or Situations 1. Rush Hour traffic 2. Children&#8217;s future 3. Work 4. Managing the home v work balance 5. Financial planning 6. Paying household bills 7. Shopping 8. New technology 9. Domestic relationships 10. Holiday trips 
 The survey, conducted to support National Stress Awareness Day&#8482; on 1 November, also shows that men find work more stressful than women (49% compared to 22%). However men are not blaming new technology as 52% of them say that it isn&#8217;t at all stressful. 
The research reveals that 70% of working adults in the UK have experienced stress in the workplace and nearly half of those surveyed (49%) indicated that their stress levels have increased over the last 12 months. 
ISMA&#8217;s Carole Spiers, Chair of the National Stress Awareness Day Committee, said: &#8220;This is the third year that we have conducted research on UK stress levels, and the figures of seven out of 10 working adults experiencing stress make shocking reading. Companies clearly have a massive problem on their hands, which they cannot afford to ignore. Unless they implement practices, policies and procedures to reduce stress, it will impact on their performance and ultimately their long-term success.&#8221;	 More/&#8230; Stress&#8230;3 	 The purpose of National Stress Awareness Day (organised by ISMAUK and in its second year of sponsorship by R&SA) is to raise the issue of stress management and firmly place it on the national agenda. ISMAUK is a registered charity who aims are to promote sound knowledge and best practice in the prevention and reduction of human stress. 
Commenting on R&SA&#8217;s sponsorship of National Stress Awareness Day, R&SA Spokesperson, Linda McCormack, said: &#8220;The removal of stress is at the heart of our business and the service we provide is all about taking the stress out of everyday situations. With counselling and advice lines, R&SA provides a sympathetic ear to complement its products that protect people. Sponsoring National Stress Awareness Day is part of our extensive stress management campaign which also includes a series of booklets on the topic such as, &#8216;Taking the Stress Out of Work&#8217; and an educational pack for secondary schools.&#8221; 
She concluded: &#8220;Our research shows that stress is a problem that is not going to go away unless we all pull together to identify and address the main causes. We are confident that by raising the profile of stress management that we can help clear up some of the common misconceptions that surround stress and provide some practical, preventative measures that really make a difference.&#8221;
