 How 
 we settle claims 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 See also general exception 
 5 and general condition 3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 a) 
 
 The amount we will pay 
 for loss or damage to the buildings will 
 be the cost of the following. 
 
 Repairing or replacing the damaged items without 
 taking off an amount for wear and tear or loss of 
 value, as long as: 
 
 
- the sum insured will cover 
 the cost of rebuilding all the buildings; 
 
 
- the buildings have been 
 maintained in good condition; and 
 
- the repair or replacement is 
 carried out immediately. 
 
 If the sum insured will not cover the loss or damage, 
 the amount we will pay will be the cost of 
 repairs or replacement less an amount for wear and 
 tear. 
 
 If the repair or replacement is not carried out, 
 the amount we will pay will be the loss of 
 value resulting from the loss or damage but not 
 more than what it would have cost to repair or replace 
 the item if this had been carried out straight away. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 b) 
 
 Demolishing, removing debris, shoring 
 up, or propping up parts of the buildings.

 tenders and supervision. We will not pay

 or other regulations or within the bylaws of any 
 local authority but only for damaged parts of the

 or sanitary fittings or other bathroom fittings as a single 
 item. We will pay you for damaged items 
 but not for the other pieces of the set or suite which 
 are not damaged. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sum insured 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The sum insured you 
 have chosen must be enough to pay for the cost of rebuilding 
 the buildings after taking account of the expenses 
 and fees mentioned in b, c and d above. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Index linking 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We will change your sum insured for buildings 
 in line with the House Rebuilding Cost Index published 
 by the Buildings Cost Information Service of the Royal 
 Institution of Chartered Surveyors. We will not 
 charge any extra premium for any increases in your 
 sum insured due to index linking during each period 
 of insurance. When we invite you to renew 
 your cover, we will show you your 
 updated sum insured and premium for the following period 
 of insurance. 
 
We may use another appropriate index as the 
 basis for changing your sum insured.
