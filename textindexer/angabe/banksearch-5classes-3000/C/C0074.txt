	Summary:
	
No excess or deductible for all computer equipment
	The no excess feature means that the cost of all insured losses would be recoverable under the policy.
	
	
- In the event of an agreed claim, a new replacement unit is supplied
	Inconvenience and disruption are eradicated &#150; when total loss occurs, equipment of the same specification is supplied without any administrative overhead.
	
- Valid claims are approved within 24 hours
	Efficient and fast settlement ensures the lost equipment can be quickly replaced. Because the policy provides specific cover for computer equipment it removes any dispute between the Insured and insurer about the scope of cover.
	
	
If, upon an agreed claim, the end user wishes to replace lost equipment with that of a higher specification, then this is allowable provided such discussions take place between the insured and the equipment supplier. The insurer's liability will be restricted to the value of direct replacement equipment only.
	
	
- No specialist security requirements
	Clients do not have to undertake any enhancements to existing security to conform to the requirements of Complete Computer Cover
	
- Terrorist cover is included as standard
	Subject to the terms of the policy, loss through terrorist act is now covered up to £100,000
	
- Theft of portable machines
	Unlike the majority of insurance covers, Complete Computer Cover provides standard cover for portable computers wherever they may be used or located. Such cover applies whether an incident takes place in the workplace, car, home or any other location &#150; including outside the UK. The only major exclusions are thefts from unattended cars where the item was not locked away from view and where equipment has been left in the open unattended. Thefts from a locked boot are covered by the policy.
	
- Absence of forcible entry does not invalidate claim
	The majority of policies require the claimant to show evidence of forcible entry or exit for a claim to be considered valid. With Complete Computer Cover this is not a requirement for claim validity- except in respect of thefts from vehicles.

- immediately notify Complete Computer Cover c/o Summit Insurance Services Ltd. of The Pavilion, 3 Broadgate, London EC2M 2QS by telephoning if practicable 020 7628 3661 and also by submission of a claim form and in the event of loss by theft, or where the Insured has reason to believe a criminal offence has been committed, notify the police and obtain a police crime number;
	
- take precautions to prevent further Damage to the Equipment and the Company shall not be liable for any further Damage resulting from the continued use of the Equipment until the Equipment has been repaired to the satisfaction of the Company;
	
- retain any damaged Equipment or parts thereof;

	Reinstatement
	
	
	
- In the event of a valid claim resulting in the replacement of all or part of the Equipment there shall be no automatic reinstatement of cover on any item or items of Equipment replaced. This means that this insurance does not cover those replacement items of Equipment during the rest of the Policy Year in which the claim occurs. The replacement Equipment may be insured on payment of an additional premium which in the case of a partial loss will be proportionate to the value of the Equipment replaced. When the Insured has purchased cover for more than one year and still has one year or more unexpired, the replacement Equipment will be insured under this policy from the start of the next Policy Year but not during the remainder of the Policy Year in which the claim has been settled unless an additional premium has been paid.
	
	Other Insurances
	
	
- If at the time of any Claim there is any other insurance effected by or on behalf of the Insured covering the Damage to the Equipment (or which would but for the existence of this policy cover it) the liability of the Company shall be limited to their rateable proportion of the sum due under this insurance.
	If this provision applies, the Insured or the other insurers shall pay to the Company the sum payable under the other insurance(s) prior to the repair or replacement of the Equipment or, at the Option of the Company, the Insured/other insurers and the Company may pay their respective contributions direct to the repair company or supplier.

- The due observance and fulfilment of the terms and conditions contained in this Policy, insofar as they relate to anything to be done or complied with by the Insured, shall be conditions precedent to any liability of the Company to replace or repair the Equipment.
	
	Arbitration
	
	
- If any difference shall arise as to the replacement or repair of Equipment under this insurance (liability being otherwise admitted) such difference shall be referred to an arbitrator to be appointed by the parties in accordance with the statutory provisions being in force at that time. Where any difference is by this condition to be referred to arbitration, the making of an award shall be a condition precedent to any right of action against the Company. The arbitration proceedings shall take place in the United Kingdom and be subject to the law of England.
	
	Cancellation
	
	
- The Company may cancel this insurance by sending ten days notice by registered post to the Insured at the address stated in the Certificate.
