Stewardship Ethical Policies
"As an investor you benefit from the activities and profit of companies. But you cannot avoid accepting some responsibility for the actions that create those profits." This is the principle on which Stewardship is based. Most of us therefore believe that we owe it to ourselves and to future generations to exercise, as far as we can, wise 'stewardship' over the companies in which we invest.
"We should support companies which aim to make a positive contribution to society, whilst encouraging those which are at present unacceptable to improve." Fulfilling this responsibility is Stewardship's aim.
The Stewardship approach is broadly split into three areas:
- Ethical Policies - decisions are made, and reviewed, regarding the ethical approach that should be adopted by the Stewardship funds across a wide range of ethical issues. Policy decisions are made by the Committee of Reference.
- Company Approval - a Sub Committee of the Committee of Reference (the Investment Sub Committee) decides which companies are acceptable for Stewardship funds to invest in by considering how their activities compare with the ethical policies of the fund.
- Company Selection - the Stewardship fund managers select the companies that they wish to invest in from the companies that are approved by the Investment Sub Committee. Companies which become 'unacceptable' must be sold by the fund managers within six months.
 
The Stewardship fund has strict ethical criteria that effect which companies the fund manager can invest in. These can be summarised as follows:
 
Stewardship actively looks to support companies involved in the following:
 
 
- Supplying the basic necessities of life
 
- Providing high quality products and services which are of long term benefit to the community
 
- Conservation of energy or natural resources
 
- Environmental improvements and pollution control
 
- Good relations with customers and suppliers
 
- Good employment practices
 
- Training and education
 
- Strong community involvement
 
- A good equal opportunities record
 
- Openness about company activities
 
 
And aims to avoid companies involved in the following:
 
 
- Environmental damage and pollution
 
- Manufacture and sale of weapons
 
- Trade with or operations in oppressive regimes
 
- Exploitation of developing countries
 
- Unnecessary exploitation of animals
 
- Nuclear power
 
- Tobacco or alcohol production
 
- Gambling
 
- Pornography
 
- Offensive or misleading advertising
 
 
(see further down this page for our policy statements)
 
As well as the screening process Stewardship has always aimed to influence the companies it supports to change for the better.
One example of this successful dialogue (which predates the creation of reo®) is between Stewardship and the Kingfisher group.
At the time it was recorded that:
 
Kingfisher is the holding company for Woolworths, B&Q, Superdrug and Darty (a leading French electrical retailing group). For a considerable time the Committee of Reference had felt uncomfortable with Kingfisher despite various areas of excellence within staff training, equal opportunities and indeed the provision of basic everyday necessities for many people's lives.
 
The problem was sourcing of timber by B&Q. Here, the company itself recognised the feelings about this issue and subsequently became a significant member of the Worldwide Fund for Nature 1995 Group on the responsible sourcing of timber. It developed positive policies in this direction and in due course made sure that Stewardship was aware of what they had done. The Committee of Reference was delighted to be able to change its position positively on this Group of companies. (1994)
