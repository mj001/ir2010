"Making a will is essential,
 especially now that house prices have soared and so many families
 have assets above £125,000........"
 
 "If you die without a will, your spouse may not receive all
 of your estate....."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Can I make sure that
 my children inherit my house?
 
 Can I reduce or eliminate the
 inheritance tax due on my estate?
 
What provision can I do to
 stop my estate from being frozen?
 
 
Can I make
 sure that the authorities can’t touch an inheritance for my disabled
 child? 
 
 
Can I make sure that
 the people I choose would be able to look after my young
 children if I died?
 
What happens to my estate if my
 partner remarries?
 
I want my house to go to my children,
 but I also want my partner to be able to live there
 until their death, without my children selling it. Can I do
 that?
 
 
 
 
 
 My
 daughter has married one of the "wrong sort". Can I make
 sure that he can’t get his hands on my money?
 
As an
 unmarried father I understand that I have no legal
 rights over my child! Is it possible for me to acquire
 these rights without getting married?
 
 
 
 These
 are just some of the many queries concerning people with children.
 We are able to offer advice and solutions to every one, and to
 hundreds of other "problems" where people often think that
 their circumstances are not resolvable.
 
Weston Financial
 Group specialise in helping families by making provision for the
 future, and by using Wills and/or Trusts to provide solutions for
 everyday problems.
