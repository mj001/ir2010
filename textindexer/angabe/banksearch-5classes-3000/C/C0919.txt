Travel and Holiday Insurance
 
Travel products can cover you for almost any destination in the 
 World, or simply for a UK weekend break. Cover for Skiing, golfing, and 
 scuba diving (all subject to conditions) can be included, and our 
 online quotation facility means you can be on cover in minutes!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Our 
 Travel insurance products provide policies from some of the longest 
 established Travel insurers, as well as those from some of the newest 
 entrants to the market, ensuring that we can offer a variety of covers 
 at sensible prices. 
 
Did you know that, if you go abroad more than once a year, an 
 Annual travel policy can be very cost-effective and could save you 
 money on the cost of individual policies? It can also remove that 
 last-minute worry of forgetting to take out insurance. Once you have 
 obtained your single-trip quote, you can obtain an annual quotation very 
 quickly as many of your details are retained- see how much you could 
 save!
 
As well as providing a good quality online service, we also 
 recognise that many travellers have special circumstances, not all of 
 which can be dealt with online. We maintain a specialist team of 
 operators, trained to find the best all-round travel deals for you and 
 your family. If you can’t obtain the deal that you require online, give 
 us a call on 08000 88888.
