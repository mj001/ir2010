With the exception of syndicate 
 587, forecast results in respect of the 1997 and 1998 years of account 
 remain unchanged from those announced on 26 August 1999. The forecasts 
 for syndicate 587 have deteriorated as a result of adverse claims 
 experience in current and prior years, particularly in relation 
 to bodily injuries. 
 
 In addition, CSL managed aviation syndicate 173 which underwrote 
 through a consortium arrangement with the Amlin PLC Group. The consortium 
 ended at 31 December 1998 and the forecast results for syndicate 
 173 remain unchanged from those previously announced (1997: -12.5% 
 to -7.5%; 1998: -15.0% to -10.0%). 
 
 These forecasts are net of standard personal expenses for an individual 
 Name at managing agent&#146;s level (ie after annual subscriptions, 
 levies and managing agents&#146; fees and commissions but before 
 members&#146; agents&#146; charges). They are made subject to the 
 usual caveats that apply to Lloyd&#146;s syndicate forecasts and 
 are based on information prepared for the 30 September 1999 Syndicate 
 Quarterly Returns. In addition, syndicate 173 forecasts are dependent 
 on the syndicate being closed into the appropriate year of account 
 of Amlin&#146;s syndicate 2001. 
 
Malcolm Mackenzie, Chief 
 Executive said: 
 
 &#147;We are pleased that our marine and non-marine syndicates have 
 maintained their positive mid point forecasts for the 1997 and 1998 
 years. The losses forecast by our motor syndicate reflect the severe 
 conditions experienced by motor underwriters.&#148;
