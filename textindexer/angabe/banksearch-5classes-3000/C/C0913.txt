 Safety precautions 
 
 
 We offer the following 
 hints on precautions worth taking. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fire prevention 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Check your electrical 
 equipment regularly. Make sure that you use the 
 correct fuses and do not overload the circuits. Ask for 
 the help of a qualified electrician if you are 
 not sure. If you leave the property for more than 
 24 hours, unplug all unnecessary appliances. Fires often 
 happen in kitchens. You can put out chip-pan fires 
 by shutting out the air. Cover the pan with a lid or thick 
 damp cloth. Do not use water or try to carry the pan out 
 of doors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Water damage 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lag exposed water pipes and 
 tanks in the roof area and taps in the garage or outbuildings. 
 Cut off the water and drain the system if you leave 
 the property without heat in winter. If pipes freeze, 
 despite your precautions, thaw them out using hot-water 
 bottles. Never use a blowlamp.
