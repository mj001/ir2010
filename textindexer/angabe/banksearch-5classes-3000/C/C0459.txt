Choose

Your campus/hall might already have insurance covering your general belongings, but you may have a few prized (valuable) possessions that you really want to protect, your laptop perhaps, a camera or guitar. Think carefully, how would you get through your course without your PC? These items may need extra cover.
	
	watchout's Best Buy policies will cover these items, both at home and on the move. What's more you can continue to protect them after you finish your studies. Policies which provide global cover and don't place restrictions on where you live offer the best value.
