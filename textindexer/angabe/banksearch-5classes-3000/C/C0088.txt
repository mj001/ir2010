 "Just a quick line to 
 thank you at Save Insurance for your excellent service, fair and affordable 
 prices and quick response to any queries. I would heartily recommend your 
 company to anyone fed up with being ripped-off by larger, greedy travel 
 insurance providers and can confirm that, after my son was hospitalised 
 during a holiday in Cyprus earlier this year, the cover provided is 
 extremely good.
 Please feel free to use these comments as you see fit."
 
 Best Regards, Andrew D.
