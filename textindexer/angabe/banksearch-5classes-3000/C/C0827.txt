How 1st-on-line works
1.	Complete and submit the appropriate online form
2.	As soon as we receive your application, we'll telephone you to discuss any questions we may have and the options open to you so that you can get the best cover at the best price. Once we've agreed the level of cover you need, we'll give you a quotation verbally. 
3.	We'll send you a notification email including a link to your online quotation, which you retrieve via the password you supply in your application form, to confirm the quote. (We'll also mail a hard copy to you for your records.)
4.	If you agree to the quotation, cover can start immediately. Simply telephone us on the number given to accept, you will need to provide payment before cover is issued, 1st-on-line.com offer a range of instalment
facilities. 
5.	We'll then issue you a cover note by mail, but your cover starts from the moment you accept by telephone. 
Before cover is confirmed and a policy sent to you we will require a signed and a satisfactorily completed proposal form as well as any documentation requested as proof of compliance.
