Community Groups
 
 
 
 
 The package of cover available is
 specifically for clubs, groups and societies using church or community premises.
Ansvar understands the special needs of a wide range of Community
 Groups. Our own research suggests that many such groups are without appropriate insurance
 cover even though it is often a condition of premises hire.
 
The cover is especially designed to provide public
 liability and a range of optional covers.
