New
 advice from PPB on 'block policies' 
 
The
 following is the content of a letter from PPB
 dated 18th August 2001 regarding "Block"
 policies.
 
 "Block" policies issued by
 Independent Insurance and effected by Property
 Management Companies and the like for the benefit
 of owners/lessees etc.
 
 PPB has received many enquiries from
 owners/lessees of properties and others in respect
 of property which is insured under
 "block" policies, seeking clarification
 of the extent to which the Policyholders
 Protection Act 1975 protects such persons.
 
 PPB has considered this with its legal advisers
 and as a result has produced the attached broad
 guidelines. It should be emphasised that the facts
 of each case will determine whether the applicant
 is protected or not but the guidelines serve to
 identify the key aspects upon which the decision
 will be based.
 
 The Joint Provisional Liquidators of Independent
 have been advised.

 Individual
 lessees, owners etc.
 
 Whilst each
 applicant for protection under the terms of the
 Policyholders Protection Act 1975 (PPA) will hinge
 on the individual circumstances of the case, the
 Policyholders Protection Board (PPB) is able to
 set down below some broad guidelines on the
 circumstances which will need to exist in order to
 establish, in principle, that protection under PPA
 applies.
 
 PPB will seek
 to identify where the insurable interest in the
 premises lies; if this is with the lessee/owner
 who is an individual and not the management
 company, landlord or other corporate body, then
 this will be indicative of likely protection.
 (This will especially be the case where the
 lessee/owner bears the liability for the costs of
 renovations and, as such, is the true beneficiary
 under the policy). 
 
 The following
 factors are likely to point towards where
 insurable interest lies:
 
 
 
 
 1. 
 The applicant will need to produce evidence of his
 title to the flat, such as a 
 copy of the
 lease;
 
 
 
 2. 
 An eligible applicant's lease will generally
 contain provisions in terms of which:
 
 
 
 a) The
 leasehold interest is demised to the lessee;
 
 
 
 
 b) The lessee
 covenants to maintain the leased property in good
 repair (and
 
 such covenants should not be subject to any
 material exceptions);
 
 
 
 
 c) The lessee
 pays a premium towards insurance cover which
 the 
 
 management company
 or landlord then covenants to effect
 
 3. The applicant's case will be materially
 strengthened if the language of
 the policy recognises the
 lessee's interest in the policy;
 
 
 
 
 4. It will assist the applicant if the claims
 process is ordinarily handled in a way that
 recognises
 his interest in the policy - as is the case, for
 example, if the policy
 benefits
 are usually paid to the individuals concerned;
 
 
 
 5. Applicants
 are able to confirm that they alone bear the duty
 to repair the damage
 insured
 under the policy.
 
 
 
Questions
 answered by the PPB
 
 
 
 
 
 
BIBA
 is publishing the minutes of a recent meeting of
 the Policyholders' Protection Board (PPB) on its
 website because both PPB and BIBA believe the
 minutes will be helpful to consumers and brokers. 
 The meeting took the form of a question and answer
 session and was attended by Aon, BIBA and Jardine
 Lloyd Thompson.
 
 
 
The
 PPB has launched its website: www.policyholdersprotectionboard.org.uk,
 which also offers helpful advice.
 
Q1 
 Is the Board willing to consider
 entering into arrangements in regard to
 those policies, which may be long-term ones
 and which do not include cancellation
 provision, whereby their transfer to another
 insurer can be facilitated?
 
 
 
A 
 The Board is not able to pay returns of
 premium to corporate policyholders. 
 However, for substantial cases where there
 is evidence, e.g. particularly adverse
 claims experience, that it would be in the
 Board’s clear financial interest to
 encourage placement of the risk elsewhere it
 would be prepared to explore whether and how
 that might be achieved. It would be
 important to ensure that the benefit of any
 reinsurance to Independent was not
 compromised in any such arrangement.
 
Q2 
 To what extent are individuals whose
 residence is insured under "block” property
 policies in the name of Management etc. companies
 protected by the 1975 Act?
 
 
 
A 
 The Board is attempting to formulate broad
 guidelines on this although cases will require
 detailed examination. The Board will be
 seeking to establish evidence to demonstrate where
 the true insurable interest in the damaged
 property lies.
 
 
 
 
Q3 
 At a recent Insurance Times seminar the PPB were
 criticised.
 
 
 
A 
 The Board is continuing to strive to meet the
 expectations of policyholders and others who have
 been prejudiced by the insolvency of
 Independent.The Board has engaged PR consultants
 to help to deal in a consistent way with the media
 and has now set up a website to enable
 individuals, brokers etc. to obtain answers to
 basic questions. The Board is always available to
 answer specific questions.
 
Q4 
 What is the Board’s stance towards the
 payment of legal etc. defence costs in
 connection with claims under protected policies?
 
A 
 It is important to bear in mind that the insurance
 of legal defence costs (although many liability
 policies include this cover) is not considered to
 be a compulsory element of insurance. For example,
 under an EL policy it is not compulsory to insure
 legal defence costs. The corollary of this
 is that whether the class of policy is in respect
 of a liability for which insurance is compulsory
 or otherwise, policyholders who are corporate
 bodies are not automatically entitled to any
 protection under the 1975 Act in respect of such
 costs. Where the policy is in the name of an
 individual and it covers such costs then, in
 principle, PPA allows for protection at 90%.
 The Board is conscious that this is a difficult
 area because it is in the Board’s (and the
 Provisional Liquidators’) interests to ensure
 that claims are properly defended in order to
 achieve fair and economic settlements. The Board
 is working with its legal advisers to define its
 stance on the payment of legal defence costs in
 respect of Independent policyholders and the
 outcome of this will be advised as soon as
 possible. 
 
 
 
Q5 
 What timeframe would be expected for the Board
 paying agree qualifying claims ?
 
 
 
A 
 The Board would seek to pay hardship cases and all
 other cases as soon as conveniently possible, upon
 receipt of adequate information. In the case of
 hardship cases, once the Board had obtained the
 appropriate documentation then they would seek to
 pay the claim within 10 working days. 
 
 
 
Q6 
 Would PPB be able to pay persons other than the
 policyholder?
 
 
 
A 
 Where the claim is in all respects a valid and
 protected one and a Deed of Assignment has been
 obtained from the policyholder who has confirmed
 authority for the Board to pay direct to another
 body, e.g. a motor repairer or builder, then the
 Board would pay such other body.
 
 
 
Q7 
 What is the Board’s position with regard to
 interim payments?
 
 
 
A 
 Interim payments could be made on qualifying
 policies. It was not a 
 
 
 
pre-requisite
 that the entire claim needed to be settled prior
 to payment.
 
 
 
Consequently
 the 90%/100% figures of interims would be
 addressed by the 
 
 
 
PPB,
 subject to the proviso as stated above.
 
Q8 
 How will deductibles on EL policies be handled?
 
A 
 Where the policy is a protected one, the
 deductible will be deducted from 
 
 
 the amount of the claim and PPB will pay 100% of
 the balance.
 
 
 
Q9 
 What is the position regarding Returns of Premiums?
 
A 
 For policies (in respect of compulsory or
 otherwise) in the name of individuals and here a
 policy contains a condition allowing cancellation
 and a return of premium, PPB will pay 90% of such
 policy return premium entitlement excluding IPT. 
 There
 is no return entitlement from PPB in respect of
 Corporate Policyholders.
 
Q10 
 Will PPB continue to pay protective claims under
 policies which have not been 
 cancelled by the Provisional Liquidators?
 
 
 
A 
 Yes.
 
Other
 information 
 
 
 
PPB
 now have a website that we and clients can refer
 to:-
 
 www.policyholdersprotectionboard.org.uk
 
(i) 
 BIBA has asked for electronic copies of the forms
 they need on claims (deed of assignment etc.) 
 
 
 
(ii) 
 PPB have a target of settling claims within 10
 days of being satisfied that it is a protected
 claim. 
 
 
 
(iii) 
 Interim payments can be claimed - clients do not
 need to wait until the claim has been settled in
 full.
 
 
 
PricewaterhouseCooper’s
 do have the authority to issue a cancellation
 notice under the Court order received on the 17th
 June 2001. Therefore, if appropriate,
 PricewaterhouseCoopers would be able to issue
 notices of cancellation on all contracts even if
 there was no formal cancellation provision
 contained therein.
