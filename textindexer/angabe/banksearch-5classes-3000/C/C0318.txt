	Epoch Software Signs Partnership Agreement With Royal & SunAlliance
	 
	
	
	
	
	29th June 2000 - 
	 
	
	
	
	
	Epoch Software, developer of the groundbreaking and widely publicised online legal service, Desktop Lawyer (www.desktoplawyer.co.uk), and DirectLaw (www.directlaw.co.uk) today announces a partnership agreement with FirstAssist, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Royal & SunAlliance, one of the UK's largest composite insurers. 
Under the terms of the agreement the two companies will promote the new Desktop Lawyer LawAssure subscription-based initiative. LawAssure is a new concept in legal services offering unlimited provision of a wide range of intelligent legal documents, and access to an online Law guide. LawAssure also offers unlimited access to legal telephone support services in conjunction with FirstAssist, and full legal expenses insurance from Royal & SunAlliance to cover disputes. 
LawAssure subscribers may select from a full range of business and personal documents, covering most routine requirements including wills, undefended divorce, confidentiality, employment, tenancy or copyright agreements, partnership deeds, acknowledgement of debt, sale of motor cars, shareholders agreements and more. 
Epoch Software will market the LawAssure service directly to the consumer and SME market through affinity groups and other similar organisations. Epoch Software and Royal & SunAlliance are also working together to establish how the LawAssure service will be best used to service Royal & SunAlliance customers. 
Epoch Software Joint CEO, Richard Cohen said: "Epoch Software is excited about teaming up with Royal & SunAlliance to offer the LawAssure service to businesses and consumers. The law should be accessible to everyone and this latest agreement means that no-one should have to pay high costs to cover ongoing routine legal services. 
"The offer of intelligent legal documents online with full unlimited legal telephone support, enables users to manage routine legal administration quickly, cheaply and independently." Steve Wood, Director of Healthcare & Assistance at Royal & SunAlliance, added: &#8220;We are delighted to be associated with this exciting and innovative service, which provides cost-effective and rapid access to comprehensive legal documents, advice and insurance services&#8221;.

Notes to Editors: Epoch Software Established in 1994 by Joint-CEO Grahame Cohen, Epoch Software is a developer of real world electronic commerce applications impacting on global vertical markets. Epoch Software&#8217;s management and technologists come from a variety of backgrounds, whose talents converge to produce a clear understanding of emerging market models, sales methodology and the development of real world software applications. 
Desktop Lawyer The first ever electronic commerce solution to deliver intelligent legal documents directly to the public via the Internet, Desktop Lawyer allows the quick and easy download of &#8216;intelligent&#8217; legal documents for businesses and consumers - such as uncontested divorce petitions, wills, guarantees, copyrights, employment and property agreements. Once downloaded, Epoch Software&#8217;s Rapidocs Assembler technology allows users to customise these documents in their own time. Producing these documents via the Desktop Lawyer service costs a fraction of the price of traditional methods. 
The user simply downloads &#8216;intelligent&#8217; legal documents (all of which have been drafted by barristers from top chambers, &#8216;11 Stone Buildings&#8217;). Once downloaded, Epoch Software&#8217;s Rapidocs Assembler technology allows users to customise these documents in their own time. 
The company&#8217;s online divorce package alone (costing £59.99) has proved so popular that in the 10 week period following its launch last year, Desktop Lawyer provided a staggering 6% of the UK's total divorce petitions for the period. Rapidocs Rapidocs is an advanced software solution that enables documents to be drafted effectively and quickly. Effective documents often require expert input, especially in critical areas such as contracts, orders, employment agreements, sales proposals, client/job applications and reports to name a few. They need to be drafted so they are clear and 'watertight'. Rapidocs ensures speed, quality and consistency of document delivery. The Rapidocs system provides an interactive template which guides the user through a series of questions. With each choice the user is assisted by embedded help text and where necessary, the invitation to seek further advice.
