Car Insurance - Cover Options
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Save up to 10% 
 for drivers aged 50+ 
 
Cornhill Direct specialise in providing affordable cover 
 for the Over 50s - our approach to car insurance is simple. 
 We believe that all vehicle owners are looking for complete 
 protection at an affordable price. That's why we offer 2 levels 
 of cover with an attractive and affordable range of options. 
 You can choose the benefits you want at a price you can afford. 
 
 
And... why should you pay for the higher 
 risk of insuring a younger driver? Our experience has shown 
 that drivers over the age of 50 are far less likely to make 
 a claim. That's why we have created a product that takes advantage 
 of better rates - meaning a cheaper insurance premium for 
 you!
