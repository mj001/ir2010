 Malcolm Mackenzie, Chief Executive, stated: 
 
 &#147;The Group continues to make progress in its development as 
 an Integrated Lloyd&#146;s Vehicle (ILV) and we are delighted to 
 report profit before tax of £5.0 million for the nine month 
 period. In addition we are pleased with the current progress of 
 the syndicates, in what is recognised as a tough market place, especially 
 the IBEX syndicate, which has seen further growth in the period.&#148;

Chairman’s 
 Statement 
 
We are pleased 
 to report a profit before tax of £5.0 million (31 March 1998 
 - £14.9 million, including £9.0 million of investment 
 gains) for the nine months to 31 December 1998. Earnings per share 
 were 6.2p (31 March 1998 - 43.1p including 29.6p of investment gains). 
 The undiluted net tangible asset value per share at the year end 
 was 77.8p (31 March 1998 - 129.7p). 
 
 Your Board has recommended a final dividend for the year of 2.0p 
 (31 March 1998 - 6.45p). The reduction in dividend reflects the 
 change in dividend policy designed to retain a higher proportion 
 of earnings to fund the growth of the Group as explained in the 
 June 1998 Listing Particulars. 
 
 The principal constituents of the profit before tax are summarised

 Notes: 
 
 Underwriting profit is derived from the Group&#146;s syndicate participations 
 on the Lloyd&#146;s 1996 year of account after making provisions 
 for syndicates expected to make losses in the 1997 and 1998 years 
 of account. 
 
The 
 merger with the HBSH Group in July 1998 has been accounted for as 
 an acquisition. Therefore only a small proportion of profit commission 
 from syndicates managed by CSL for the 1996 year of account will 
 be included above. In addition, a charge for amortisation of acquisition 
 goodwill (which is to be written-off over 20 years) has been made. 
 
 
 The period under review has seen significant progress in the development 
 of the Group as an Integrated Lloyd's Vehicle (ILV). The merger 
 with HBSH, the ultimate holding company of Chaucer Syndicates Limited 
 (CSL), was completed on 23 July 1998. The Company was renamed Chaucer 
 Holdings PLC to reflect the change in emphasis of the Group. 
 
 Despite difficult underwriting conditions, I am pleased with the 
 Group&#146;s progress and am confident that it is in good shape 
 to take advantage of the opportunities which we expect to emerge.

Chief Executive's Review 
 
 
 
 
Integration 
 of Capacity 
 
The 
 merger with HBSH was completed in sufficient 
 time for the Group to take an active part in the 1998 Lloyd's capacity 
 auctions. As a result, £42.9 million (73%) of the Group&#146;s 
 spread underwriting capacity was aligned with syndicates managed 
 by CSL for the 1999 account at a cost of £1.9 million. The 
 balance of £15.6 million has been allocated to third party 
 managed syndicates, enabling the Group to continue to participate 
 on syndicates which complement the underwriting activities of CSL&#146;s 
 managed syndicates, or on syndicates whose capacity the Directors 
 believe has potential to increase in value. A further £16.7 
 million interest in 1999 underwriting capacity on CSL syndicates 
 is provided through the Group&#146;s interest in Chaucer Dedicated 
 Limited resulting in total underwriting capacity in 1999 of £75.2 
 million for the Group overall. 
 
Aberdeen 
 Lloyd&#146;s Insurance Trust (ALIT) Corporate Members 
 
For 
 the 1996 underwriting year, the ALIT corporate members had allocated 
 capacity of £58.5 million on a spread of 55 syndicates. This 
 produced a basic underwriting profit of £4.0 million (6.8%). 
 After adjustment for the additional central fund levy for corporate 
 members and the special levy rebate, members&#146; agent&#146;s 
 fees and profit commission and a provision for syndicates expected 
 to make losses in the future, the contribution was £1.9 million 
 (31 March 1998: £6.1 million). The provision for syndicates 
 forecasting losses in the 1997 and 1998 years is £2.2 million 
 (£0.8 million for 1997 and £1.4 million for 1998), an 
 increase of £1.8 million over the corresponding provision 
 at 31 March 1998. 
 
The 
 provisions are made on the basis of the ICAEW&#146;s January 1999 
 Technical Release on financial statements of Lloyd&#146;s corporate 
 members. We have used managing agents&#146; current mid-point estimates 
 (or, where relevant, by extrapolation of published comments) of 
 the results of loss making syndicates on which the Group underwrites 
 in 1997 and 1998. No account has been taken of potentially profit 
 making syndicates which for 1997, on the basis of current mid-point 
 estimates, show profits greater than the £0.8 million of provisions 
 for that year. 
 
The 
 1997 account on which the ALIT corporate members had allocated capacity 
 of £53.2 million has been characterised by a decline in premium 
 income and continuing downward pressure on rates as underwriters 
 compete for market share. There has also been a notable increase 
 in the level of gross claims incurred by most Lloyd&#146;s syndicates 
 (particularly aviation) and the motor market has been very weak. 
 The availability of competitive reinsurance however has helped the 
 net underwriting position. Current forecasts indicate a gross underwriting 
 result in the range of 3.7% profit to a loss of 1.5% on capacity. 
 
 
Total 
 underwriting capacity for the 1998 account was increased to £60.3 
 million primarily in anticipation that capacity would become harder 
 and more expensive to acquire and this proved to be the case in 
 1998 as managing agents endeavoured to establish ILVs by aligning 
 capacity with managed syndicates. It is expected that underwriting 
 returns will show a further deterioration over those of 1997 reflecting 
 the continued depressed market conditions. 
 
 As part of the strategy of realigning underwriting capacity to syndicates 
 managed by the Group, the ALIT corporate members sold or relinquished 
 £44.4 million of third party capacity in the Lloyd&#146;s 
 auctions in 1998 at a profit of £3.8 million. The Group is 
 likely to sell the balance of £15.6 million of third party 
 capacity in this year&#146;s auctions. 
 
Chaucer 
 Syndicates Limited (CSL) 
 
 CSL is the principal operating subsidiary of the Group. Syndicates 
 managed by CSL participate in each of the four main markets at Lloyd's: 
 aviation, motor, marine and non marine. The four CSL syndicates 
 active in 1996 each produced underwriting returns above the mid-point 
 of the ranges forecast at the time of the merger and showed an underwriting 
 profit of 5.3%. This generated profit commission for the Group of 
 £1.5 million, the majority of which has been treated as arising 
 prior to the acquisition of HBSH. 
 
 
1997 
 is expected to produce a gross underwriting result of between a 
 profit of 3.0% and a loss of 2.0%. While, with the exception of 
 Syndicate 173, the managed syndicates&#146; results compare respectably 
 against their individual peer groups the trend in profitability 
 reflects the general state of the present underwriting cycle. We 
 do not expect our managed syndicates to be affected by the extended 
 warranty or &#145;Unicover&#146; losses that have been announced 
 recently. 
 
Current 
 market conditions remain extremely difficult, not just at Lloyd&#146;s 
 but in insurance markets generally. In spite of the frequency of 
 natural catastrophes and aviation losses, such as hurricanes Georges 
 and Mitch and the Swissair disaster, competition for insurance business 
 remains strong. Clients are able to negotiate increasingly wide 
 and flexible terms at highly competitive rates. It is difficult 
 to see how this situation can be sustained and there are signs that 
 some insurers have had enough and are withdrawing from the market. 
 It seems likely that further withdrawals are inevitable before markets 
 can return to sensible rating conditions. 
 
On 
 a more optimistic note there are signs that the motor market is 
 beginning to improve. Fleet rates are hardening and the private 
 car market is following suit. This is encouraging but underwriting 
 such business at Lloyd&#146;s is challenging and we continue to 
 investigate ways in which we can improve margins in this and all 
 personal lines insurance. 
 
In 
 spite of market conditions we have taken the opportunity to expand 
 capacity of the syndicates managed by Chaucer for 1999 from £226 
 million to £257 million, a 14% increase. We decided to effect 
 this increase in order to accommodate a new aviation account within 
 Syndicate 1084 following the cessation of Syndicate 173, to take 
 advantage of an anticipated upturn in motor business and to enhance 
 our presence in the non-marine sector. 
 
 We continue to build a strong and dynamic business at Chaucer. We 
 were pleased to be able to appoint an experienced and respected 
 aviation underwriter who came to us from Ace aviation Syndicate 
 925 to set up, with a number of his colleagues, the new aviation 
 account. Other areas in which we have begun to develop business 
 opportunities include Political Risk, Onshore Energy and a new book 
 of US binding authority business. To complement our underwriting 
 capabilities we have strengthened the management team during 1998 
 with the appointment of an Operations Director, a Group Actuary, 
 a Head of IT and a new Company Secretary. We are now confident that 
 we have in place a balanced senior executive team of underwriters 
 and managers with sufficient strength in depth to develop Chaucer 
 as an independent listed insurance business at Lloyd&#146;s. The 
 professional development of all our managers continues to be a high 
 priority. 
 
Aviation 
 Syndicate 173 
 
 In 1998 CSL and Amlin Underwriting Management Ltd (formerly Murray 
 Lawrence & Partners Ltd) mutually agreed to cease the Consortium 
 Agreement under the terms of which Syndicate 173 was managed. 
 
 We are pleased to report that we have now successfully negotiated 
 the closure of Syndicate 173&#146;s 1996 year of account into the 
 1997 year of Amlin Syndicate 2001 on the equivalent terms to its 
 consortium partner Syndicate 824&#146;s own closure arrangements. 
 Amlin have also indicated that, subject to the normal closure of 
 Syndicate 2001, Syndicate 173&#146;s 1997 and 1998 years may be 
 closed into Syndicate 2001 on the equivalent terms to the closure 
 of the 1997 and 1998 years of its aviation component. 
 
Syndicate 
 2222 
 
In 
 June 1998 we announced our intention to merge the three CSL managed 
 syndicates (587, 1084 and 1096) to form a new combined syndicate 
 for the 2000 year of account, Syndicate 2222. The merger would allow 
 more efficient use of capital, aid the implementation of our plans 
 for the business and, in the fullness of time, generate economies 
 of scale to enable the business to be run more cost effectively. 
 
 
 Discussions have taken place with members&#146; agents and corporate 
 capital providers to explain our proposals and to gauge the expected 
 level of support from members. We cannot yet judge whether we will 
 obtain the required level of support (75% vote by underwriting capacity 
 for each syndicate) for the merger. If it is not forthcoming we 
 will postpone the merger for a further year. 
 
Chaucer 
 Dedicated Limited (CDL) 
 
 CDL is a corporate member established in late 1995 to provide dedicated 
 underwriting capacity to CSL syndicates. It is owned by the Chaucer 
 Group and three external investors. At a time when raising capital 
 to support the syndicates could be difficult, CDL is an important 
 part of our capacity raising capability. CDL contributes £50 
 million of the overall total managed capacity of £257 million. 
 The Group has a 100% share in 1996 and 1997 profits and a 33% share 
 in 1998 and 1999 profits. Shareholders in CDL agreed an increase 
 in capacity from £30 million to £50 million for 1999 
 which was obtained by the purchase of additional Chaucer capacity 
 in the Lloyd&#146;s capacity auctions at a cost of some £1.1 
 million. For the 1996 year of account, CDL generated pre-tax profits 
 of £0.2 million. 
 
Investments 
 
 
Shortly 
 before 31 March 1998, the Group switched its main investment portfolio 
 into the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust, a UK equities fund. At 31 
 December 1998, the holding was 46.4 million units with a value of 
 £37.9 million. As reported with the six month results to 30 
 September 1998, the fund had suffered along with the rest of the 
 UK market. It recovered well in the last three months of the year 
 to show a 0.4% gain for the nine months to 31 December 1998 which 
 compares favourably with its benchmark index (the FTSE All-Share 
 Index) which recorded a loss of 3.9%. 
 
 Shareholders will be aware that the UK stockmarket performed strongly 
 in the latter part of 1998 and on 19 January 1999, the opportunity 
 was taken to move 40% of the Group&#146;s investments into a fixed 
 interest fund. As a result, the Company sold 18.0 million units 
 in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust to realise approximately £15.0 
 million and used the proceeds to purchase 50.0 million units in 
 the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust. The balance of the investment 
 portfolio remains invested in 28.5 million units in the Aberdeen 
 UK Growth Unit Trust. 
 
Aberdeen 
 Underwriting Advisers (AUA) 
 
 Following the merger of ALIT and HBSH it became increasingly clear 
 that AUA did not form part of the long term strategy for the Group. 
 We were therefore pleased to announce the sale of AUA to the Hampden 
 Group on 22 January 1999 where it will become part of an organisation 
 committed to the future of private capital at Lloyd&#146;s and where 
 the interests of the staff of AUA should be reasonably safeguarded. 
 AUA made a loss before tax of £0.1 million for the nine months 
 to 31 December 1998 after writing down assets and goodwill to values 
 achieved in the sale. 
 
Outlook 
 
 
 &#145;To underwrite for income is to court disaster&#146; is a long 
 established underwriting mantra. Faced with difficult underwriting 
 conditions our approach at Chaucer remains firm. We seek to sustain 
 a core book of business while maintaining underwriting disciplines 
 established to ensure that we underwrite business which we regard 
 as properly rated and which we believe to be profitable. 
 
Shareholders 
 will appreciate that the application of such a policy means that, 
 regrettable though it is, we may be forced to under utilise our 
 capacity. We make no apology for this particularly because we believe 
 that this strategy will, in so far as it is achievable, ensure that 
 our capital providers are not exposed to unnecessary risk. In these 
 difficult conditions we remain determined to maintain underwriting 
 disciplines even if this results in poor underwriting capacity utilisation 
 and to work hard to meet client needs and develop new client markets. 
 
 
 The principal objectives for 1999 will be to align the remaining 
 spread capacity with our managed syndicates, to establish the new 
 aviation team which recently joined syndicate 1084 and to continue 
 the expansion of underwriting business. This expansion can be achieved 
 by establishing new businesses or entering into appropriate arrangements 
 with established insurance businesses and by attracting first class 
 individuals to bring new business to the Group. A Business Development 
 team has been set up for the purpose. On 28 April 1999 we announced 
 the creation of a new company Chaucer GmbH based in Hannover, Germany 
 to assist in development of European business for syndicates managed 
 by CSL. 
 
 Our ultimate objective will be to capitalise the business so that 
 the Chaucer Group can supply 100% of the capacity of our own syndicates 
 over the next 
 three to five years. Until then we will continue to welcome capacity 
 from whatever source. We will however adopt a policy of &#147;flexible 
 response&#148; to ensure that whatever decisions underwriting members 
 of Lloyd&#146;s take about their continuing participation in the 
 market we will never be without the capacity we require to run a 
 vibrant and dynamic insurance business at Lloyd&#146;s. We do not 
 anticipate increasing managed capacity for the 2000 year of account. 
 
 
 
 
 While the containment of costs remains a high priority we must also 
 ensure that our business has the facilities and resources to remain 
 competitive. New premises have been occupied in Devonshire Square 
 on the expiry of our old lease in September 1998. This has presented 
 us with the opportunity to upgrade our systems and communications. 
 In addition to installing an appropriate technology network we continue 
 to implement plans to introduce a new underwriting and management 
 information system for the Group. The motor syndicate, particularly 
 in the context of an improving motor market, has outgrown its premises 
 in Canterbury where it currently occupies two sites. After a long 
 search we have decided to meet its requirements by building new 
 offices which will be leased to the syndicate for occupation in 
 early 2000.
