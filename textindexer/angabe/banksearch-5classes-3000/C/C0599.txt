Malcolm Mackenzie, Chief Executive said: 
 
 &#147;We are delighted that the 1996 results for all four syndicates 
 are above the mid point of the ranges forecast last Summer at the 
 time of the merger. We believe that the syndicate results will compare 
 well with their peer groups and in particular IBEX syndicate 587 
 will be one of the very few motor syndicates to show a profit for 
 Names.&#148;
