13. What prevents the policy paying out for disability
 
 We will not pay out for disability if:
 
 
 
- You do not tell us about your claim for disability within 
 six months of the event.
 
- You were aware at the start date of any circumstance 
 that would lead to you making a claim for disability under 
 the policy, or in our reasonable opinion you should have 
 been aware.
 
- Your disability is caused by a self-inflicted injury, 
 alcohol abuse, drug abuse or you fail to follow any medical 
 advice.
 
- Your disability is caused by stress, anxiety, depression 
 or any other nervous disorder unless a suitably qualified 
 consultant certifies that the condition prevents you from 
 working.
 
- Your disability is caused by any pre-existing condition.
 
- Your disability is caused by pregnancy or a normal pregnancy 
 related condition (other than a medical complication which 
 happens as a result of your pregnancy).
 
- Your disability is caused by backache or a back related 
 condition where there is no physical or radiological evidence 
 of a medical abnormality unless a suitably qualified consultant 
 certifies that the condition prevents you from working.
 
- Your disability arises from any operation or treatment 
 which is not medically necessary.
 
- You are doing any other job for payment or reward or 
 you are receiving any form of payment or reward for helping, 
 managing or carrying out any part of the day to day running 
 of your business.
 
- Your disability is caused by any of the unemployment 
 exclusions.
