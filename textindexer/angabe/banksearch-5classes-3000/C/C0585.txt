The PoundGates
 Group 
 
 
 
 
 PoundGates, a diverse, but integrated insurance group employing 
 over 50 staff.
 
The broad-based skills of the Group have created an environment where 
 many of the functions of the insurance industry are represented in a single 
 organisation.
 
Not only do we act as traditional insurance brokers but we also underwrite 
 and produce policy documentation, handle claims and recover costs from 
 third parties. We provide comprehensive survey and risk management services 
 that minimise the likelihood and total cost of losses for our clients.
 
Uniquely strong in both marine and non-marine insurance contracts we 
 operate branded schemes for a broad range of commercial sectors.
 
Our largest cost and most important resource is our people. We motivate 
 and manage our staff on the Investor in People principles and directly 
 link their reward to the success of our business.
 
We also seek to invest in our community providing work experience opportunities 
 for local schools, sponsoring an athletics event on behalf of an Ipswich 
 hospice and by making charitable donations to organisations such as Macmillan 
 Cancer Relief, Multiple Sclerosis Society and Guide Dogs for the Blind. 
 Our staff participate widely in these charitable initiatives.
