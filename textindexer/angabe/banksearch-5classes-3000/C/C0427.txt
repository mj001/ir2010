You
 should always provide details of any circumstances that may affect this
 commercial insurance policy. 
 
If you are in
 any doubt you should disclose any information you think may be
 relevant. Failure to disclose information could make the
 policy invalid or affect the premium rates. 
 
Alpha
 Insurance Consultants only provide Insurance for UK residents. 
 
The
 quotations provided are subject to acceptance of the Insurance
 Underwriters. 
 
If you fail
 to make payment for your Insurance it could result in a charge being
 added to cover administration expenses incurred by Alpha Insurance
 Consultants or the finance company in pursuit of debt recovery. 
 
A
 administration charge can also be applied if any additional changes need
 to be made to the policy, including the request for a duplicate
 document.
 
Make sure you
 keep all documentation safe regarding your cover for Insurance,
 including letters.
