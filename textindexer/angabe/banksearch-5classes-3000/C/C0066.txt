 Movers 
 Plus is a unique combined insurance facility designed specifically for 
 the Removal and Storage industry
 
 
 
 
 
User Friendly Policy
 The policy is designed to incorporate all the removers non-motor insurance 
 requirements into a single, streamlined but focused policy to ease your 
 administration.
 
This is further supported 
 by the absence of complicated proposal forms or need for regular declarations. 
 The scheme allows you to regulate the policy yourself and cuts out unnecessary 
 paperwork.
 
The are four key sections 
 to the policy:
 
 
- Contractual and 
 Legal Liability for your customers goods.
 
- All Risks for 
 customers goods
 
- Employers, public 
 and products liability
 
- Combined Commercial 
 covers (buildings, contents, stock and business interruption)
 
 
The policy even comes 
 with two separate schedules, one showing cover provided the other with 
 premium details, so you can safely assure customers of the level of cover 
 you have without having to release sensitive information.
 
Focused Cover
 Policy cover has been negotiated to the highest standards and largely 
 follows the latest British Association of Removers (BAR) contract terms 
 and conditions. However, it is not restricted to BAR members and can accommodate 
 non-BAR members and those who carry full liability.
 
In addition to the 
 modernised standard wording, the scheme also offers very relevant extensions 
 which are not usually available to removal companies. Examples are "New 
 for Old" cover being incorporated as standard cover or on an "as 
 and when" basis to suit your business.
 
Premium Savings
 By combining together varying types of cover into one policy savings against 
 more fragmented policies are virtually guaranteed. In some cases savings 
 of up to 50% have been achieved.
 
Other Features
 
 
- Flexibility to 
 increase liability limits (subject to additional premiums)
 
 
- International movements 
 can be covered
 
 
- Motor risks can 
 be considered
