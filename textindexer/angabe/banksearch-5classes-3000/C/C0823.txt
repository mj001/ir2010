	ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE HALF YEAR NEW BUSINESS - UK LIFE, PENSIONS & INVESTMENTS 
	 
	
	
	
	
	8th February 2001 - 
	 
	
	
	
	
	Royal & SunAlliance today announced new UK life, pensions and investment sales of £811.5 million for the first half of this year. 
Commenting, Stephan Pater, Managing Director, UK Life & Pensions, said: 
&#8220;Our excellent performance in 2000, combined with tough trading conditions in the first half of this year, and our determination to only focus on lines of business where we can achieve adequate returns, are reflected in overall sales results. However, we continue to make good progress in our chosen markets and we are pleased with the relationships and support we are receiving from Independent Financial Advisers (IFAs), who account for 85% of new life and pensions sales. 
&#8220;Our strategy of focusing on group pensions, rather than stakeholder business, is working well. We are increasingly being seen as a serious pension player and have had great success in winning large scheme business. Our strengths in the corporate business market contributed to a 30% increase in pension sales to £64 million in the first half, including a 94% increase in single premium group pensions. 
&#8220;With our award-winning corporate portfolio, new web-enabled pensions range and superior investment performance, we are well placed to prosper from the current surge of activity in the pensions market as we approach the 8 October deadline for employers to offer employees pension scheme access. 
&#8220;Our strong corporate positioning is further underlined by a 35% rise in group risk sales, to £126 million, an area where we already hold a 17% market share. We have also recently re-launched our pay-as-you-go Progressive Protection term assurance to strengthen our business protection package, building on our established underwriting expertise and IFA technical support. 
&#8220;Our institutional pensions business also continues to grow. Several of the UK&#8217;s leading investment consultants now regularly recommend us and we have won &#8216;beauty parades&#8217; this year in competition with other leading institutional fund managers. The number of pension fund clients and our market share continues to increase. Our flagship Mixed Pooled Pension Fund now has a market share of over 1%. 
&#8220;We continued to expand our investment business with the launch of the UK Prime Fund, the first in a range of Prime Funds providing tightly focused investments of around 30 equity holdings. The Fund was well received by investors, intermediaries and the media alike, enhancing our growing reputation as a provider of innovative investment solutions. 
&#8220;We expanded the distribution capability of both our retail and institutional businesses. The retail business by linking up with three more of the market leading fund supermarkets and the institutional business with an expansion of our sales team. 
&#8220;Sales of retail funds continue to make excellent progress despite very difficult market conditions, increasing by over 19% in the first half of 2001 and taking our market share for ISA and PEP Transfer business to the industry significant level of 1%. 
&#8220;Overall investment sales continue to reflect very strong sales in the first half of last year, and particularly a one-off strategic change in the asset allocation of a number of institutional clients&#8217; portfolios, which resulted in investments being made via collective schemes rather than directly.&#8221; 
&#8220;Deteriorating investment conditions in the first half have undoubtedly had an adverse impact on investor confidence and our investment bond sales. However, we believe we have the fundamentals in place, with our innovative new Lifestyle Investment Bond which has been well received by IFAs, and the right distribution strategy, to benefit from any upturn in the investment market during the second half of this year.&#8221;
