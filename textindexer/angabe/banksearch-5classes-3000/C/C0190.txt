 &#147;Although it gives us no pleasure to report a loss, it is important 
 that this is taken in context. We have now strengthened our provisions 
 for underwriting losses from the 1998 and 1999 years to the level 
 of our stop loss cover. Having addressed the issues arising from 
 1998 and 1999 we can now concentrate our resources on the future 
 which we regard with increasing optimism now that we have evidence 
 of a material improvement in the motor market. The Group&#146;s 
 marine and non marine syndicates will perform well against their 
 peer groups in the next two years and we believe that their markets 
 have now passed the low point of the cycle.&#148;

Chairman’s 
 Statement 
 
Introduction
 
 The year under review has seen difficult underwriting conditions. 
 Our markets have remained extremely competitive, although there 
 is now good evidence of a return towards sensible rating conditions 
 in the motor insurance market and we can see early signs of a potential 
 improvement in our other principal business areas of marine and 
 non-marine.
 
 
Results
 
 We report a loss before tax of £1.1 million for the year ended 
 31 December 1999 compared to a profit before tax of £5.0 million 
 for nine months ended 31 December 1998. Earnings per share showed 
 a loss of 0.7p (31 December 1998 &#150; profit of 6.2p). The undiluted 
 net tangible asset value per share at 31 December 1999 remains almost 
 unchanged at 77.6p (31 December 1998 &#150; 77.8p).
 
It has been decided 
 to reduce the final dividend from that paid last year in order to 
 retain resources within the Group. Accordingly, your Directors have 
 declared a final dividend for the year of 1.0p net per share (31 
 December 1998 &#150; 2.0p). The dividend will be paid on 14 July 
 2000 to shareholders on the Company&#146;s register at close of 
 business on 5 June 2000. A scrip alternative will be offered to 
 shareholders and your directors and two largest shareholders have 
 agreed to elect for shares instead of the cash dividend.

 Management Changes
 
 On 3 March 2000, we announced that Malcolm Mackenzie, Group Chief 
 Executive, had decided to retire early following his recent ill 
 health. Malcolm has been Chief Executive of the Group since its 
 inception in 1997, following a distinguished career at Lloyd&#146;s. 
 We will miss his leadership and experience and wish him a speedy 
 recovery. We also announced that Ray Brick, underwriter of Syndicate 
 587, who is now aged 58 decided that the time was right to hand-over 
 to his deputy. Ray has had a long and successful career at Lloyd&#146;s 
 and we will benefit through the recovery strategy he has helped 
 to implement at Syndicate 587. 
 
We 
 wish both them well for the future and thank them for their invaluable 
 contributions to the Group.
 
 
Consequent 
 upon these two retirements, we have made a number of management 
 changes, principally at our main operating subsidiary, Chaucer Syndicates 
 Limited, where Hugh Hayward becomes Chairman, Bob Stuchbery, Underwriting 
 Director and Ewen Gilmour, Managing Director. In addition, Bruce 
 Bartell becomes Underwriter of Syndicate 1096, Mary Towndrow, Underwriter 
 of Syndicate 587 and Nick Adams, Compliance Officer. Ewen Gilmour 
 also becomes Group Managing Director.
 
 
Outlook
 
 We remain vigilant in our underwriting philosophy and our management 
 team continues to build a business that is capable of capitalising 
 on future opportunities. We are nearing the end of a particularly 
 weak underwriting market and view the future with a degree of confidence.

Managing Director's Review 
 
 
 
 
Chaucer 
 Strategy and Position
 
 It is now two years since the Group announced proposals to become 
 an Integrated Lloyd&#146;s Vehicle based on the Chaucer managed 
 syndicates. We have made significant progress towards that goal, 
 having sold the balance of the Group&#146;s participations on third 
 party syndicates in 1999 and for the 2000 year all the Group&#146;s 
 underwriting interests are allied to the three Chaucer syndicates. 
 With our associated company, Chaucer Dedicated Limited, we now control 
 £131.5 million of Chaucer syndicate capacity, representing 
 52%. Our own underwriting interest in Chaucer syndicates for the 
 2000 year is £93.3 million.
 
Shareholders 
 will realise that with net tangible assets of £34.4 million 
 we have an effective underwriting ratio of 2.7 times and will not 
 wish to extend this further until we can be certain of strong underwriting 
 profits. In the absence of the necessary appetite for equity fund 
 raisings, we are likely to fund the Group&#146;s underwriting capacity 
 needs by way of reinsurance arrangements with insurance companies.
 
The 
 results we are now reporting comprise a number of elements and in 
 this transitional phase from &#145;spread&#146; to &#145;integrated&#146; 
 underwriting, shareholders may not find the position as easily understandable 
 as a conventional insurance company. For the year to 31 December 
 1999, we account for calendar year fees, expenses and investment 
 income and gains. However in underwriting terms, we account for 
 the results of the 1997 year of account and make provisions for 
 expected losses in 1998 and 1999. Over 80% underwriting participations 
 for 1997 and 1998 are based on syndicates managed by third parties. 
 The position will become more transparent in subsequent years, particularly 
 with a move to annual accounting.Current 
 
 Underwriting Markets
 
 The downturn in the present insurance cycle started in late 1995/early 
 1996, and probably earlier in the motor sector. For Lloyd&#146;s, 
 results were reasonable in 1996 but have moved to a marginal loss 
 in 1997. Losses for 1998 and 1999 will be heavy and although some 
 improvement is hoped for in 2000, most commentators are expecting 
 another loss. 
 
The 
 motor market has been particularly weak. Margins are tight and, 
 in recent years, motor underwriters generally have charged insufficient 
 premiums to meet the cost of claims and servicing the business. 
 Legislative changes, the impact of the Ogden judgment and an increasingly 
 litigious society have worsened the position. Our motor syndicate 
 (587), whilst steadily increasing premium rates since 1998 and taking 
 advantage of improvements in the fleet market, has not been immune 
 from these problems. Although the syndicate&#146;s results are disappointing, 
 we can draw some comfort from the fact that early figures for the 
 2000 year are considerably improved. 
 
In 
 the marine, aviation and non-marine markets in which we operate, 
 competition has been strong with premium rates in many classes at 
 unacceptable levels. We continue to be resolute in maintaining our 
 underwriting disciplines and to turn away business where the premium 
 is insufficient or the terms are inadequate. To date, the large 
 claims in 1998 and 1999 have done little to quench the market&#146;s 
 thirst for business in these areas and although we believe that 
 these markets have reached their low point, we remain sanguine about 
 the strength of the upturn until we have the experience of a number 
 of months improvements in premium rates.
 
Group 
 Stop Loss
 
 During the latter half of 1999, we negotiated a stop loss policy 
 with a major European reinsurance company to cover potential deterioration 
 on Chaucer Holdings&#146; underwriting participations (both direct 
 and through Chaucer Dedicated) for the 1997, 1998 and 1999 years 
 of account. Broadly, the policy covers total losses in excess of 
 5.75% of capacity up to a level of 10%. The policy will not have 
 any bearing on the 1997 year as losses are well below the threshold 
 but could well be of use for the other two years. We have made provisions 
 for the 1998 and 1999 years up to the level at which the stop loss 
 policy cuts in and therefore in the absence of a very severe deterioration 
 through the 10% threshold, the Group will suffer no further adverse 
 effects from these two years.
 
Results 
 for 1997 and Prior Underwriting Years
 
 For the 1997 year, the Group underwrote £53.2 million of capacity 
 on a portfolio of 49 third party managed syndicates. The portfolio 
 showed an underwriting loss of £0.9 million which was matched 
 by a provision set up at the time the accounts to 31 December 1998 
 were prepared and therefore the Group results for the year under 
 review are not affected by these figures. The Group had one participation 
 on a syndicate left open from the 1996 year which showed a deterioration 
 of £0.2 million which is charged to the 31 December 1999 result.
 
 Through its shareholding in Chaucer Dedicated Limited, the Group 
 had a £10.0 million interest in a portfolio of Chaucer managed 
 syndicates in the 1997 year. The Group&#146;s share of the attributable 
 losses was £0.2 million which, after taking account of a small 
 carried forward provision and expenses for the year, led to a charge 
 of £0.3 million.
 
Forecasts 
 for the 1998 and 1999 Underwriting Years
 
 We have received forecasts for the 1998 underwriting year prepared 
 for the Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate Quarterly Returns at 31 December 
 1999 and have made estimates for the 1999 underwriting year from 
 our own knowledge of Chaucer managed syndicates and by extrapolation 
 from published comments from third party managed syndicates.For 
 the 1998 year, the Group underwrote £60.0 million of capacity 
 on a portfolio of 47 third party managed syndicates. 
 
 The mid-points of the syndicate forecasts show that our stop loss 
 policy could be activated and accordingly we have increased our 
 net provisions to the policy threshold of £3.6 million. This 
 compares with a £1.5 million provision in the accounts to 
 31 December 1998 and therefore an additional £2.1 million 
 has been charged to the profit and loss account for the year ended 
 31 December 1999.
 
 For the 1999 year, the Group underwrote £58.5 million of capacity, 
 of which £42.9 million was allocated to Chaucer managed syndicates 
 and £15.6 million to syndicates managed by other agents. Although 
 the mid-points of the forecasts show an underwriting loss marginally 
 below our stop loss policy threshold we have made provisions to 
 the policy threshold of £3.6 million. 
 
 Through its shareholding in Chaucer Dedicated Limited, the Group 
 has a £10.0 million interest in a portfolio of Chaucer managed 
 syndicates for the 1998 year and £16.7 million for the 1999 
 year. The Group has provided for its share of the attributable syndicate 
 mid-point forecast losses of £0.4 million (1998) and £0.7 
 million (1999).

We are delighted with the results and forecasts for 
 Syndicates 1084 and 1096 which compare most favourably with their 
 market peers. Syndicate 587 has suffered along with the majority 
 of Lloyd&#146;s motor syndicates and will still be loss making in 
 the 1999 year.In addition, Chaucer managed aviation Syndicate 173 
 which underwrote through a consortium arrangement with Amlin Underwriting 
 Limited. The agreement was terminated at the end of 1998 and the 
 syndicate placed in run-off. The result for the 1997 year was a 
 loss of 7.7% and the forecast loss for the 1998 year is 10.0% to 
 15.0%. The 1997 year was closed into Amlin Syndicate 2001 and it 
 is anticipated that the 1998 year will close similarly into that 
 syndicate on equivalent terms to the closure of its aviation component.
 
 Chaucer Managed Capacity in 2000
 
 Managed capacity on our own syndicates for 2000 remains approximately 
 the same as for 1999 although the balance has altered. Motor capacity 
 increased by 5.9% to take advantage of the upturn in rates and non-marine 
 capacity by 21.2% to exploit a number of opportunities. Due to highly 
 competitive conditions in the marine and aviation markets we decided 
 to reduce capacity on Syndicate 1084 by 22.5%.

 Capacity Acquisition
 
 We have been active in this year&#146;s Capacity Auctions. 
 We sold the remaining £15.6 ALIT spread portfolio, for £2.4 
 million, giving a profit of £2.2 million. As part of our ILV 
 strategy we acquired £29.8 million of capacity on our own 
 managed syndicates at a cost of £0.9 million, together with 
 £4.0 million at a cost of £0.1 million for Chaucer Dedicated 
 Limited.
 
Investments
 
 At the commencement of the year under review, the Group held 46.4 
 million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust with a value 
 of £37.9 million. On 19 January 1999, the opportunity was 
 taken to move 40% of the Group&#146;s investments into a fixed interest 
 fund. As a result, the Company sold 18.0 million units in the Aberdeen 
 UK Growth Unit Trust to realise approximately £15.0 million 
 and used the proceeds to purchase 50.0 million units in the Aberdeen 
 Fixed Interest Unit Trust. On 5 May 1999, we sold a further 13.5 
 million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and invested 
 in a further 38.2 million units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit 
 Trust. 
 
The investment portfolio at 31 December 1999 comprised 
 15.1 million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and 88.6 
 million units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust. The value 
 of the portfolio at 31 December 1999 was £41.5 million, and 
 has given the Group an investment gain of £3.4 million for 
 the year. The Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust continued to perform 
 well, showing an increase of 19.9%, outperforming the FTSE 100 by 
 2%. The Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust is unlikely to produce 
 the same capital appreciation but carries a yield of 8%.
 
 At the end of February 2000, in order to generate more income and 
 to reduce volatility, we decided to sell the Company&#146;s remaining 
 holding of Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and invest the proceeds 
 of £13.3 million in the Aberdeen High Yield Bond Unit Trust. 
 The Company&#146;s investments now comprise 88.6 million units in 
 the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust and 13.4 million units in 
 the Aberdeen High Yield Bond Unit Trust.
 
Chaucer Europe
 
 In line with plans to expand our underwriting business, we have 
 successfully established two new European businesses. In April 1999 
 we announced the establishment of Chaucer GmbH based in Hanover, 
 Germany and, shortly afterwards, the acquisition of the business 
 of the Vesta Fire Insurance Corporation of America based in Copenhagen. 
 These businesses have been acquired in order to establish, at low 
 cost, a presence in Europe from which to develop business. As access 
 to new business increases we expect to see further developments 
 of this kind.
 
 Syndicate 587 Office
 
 On 16 September 1999, we signed a contract to purchase 4 acres of 
 freehold land at Whitstable near Canterbury on which a new 35,000 
 square foot office for the motor syndicate (587) will be built. 
 Work is well underway and occupation is scheduled for September 
 2000. The site has planning permission for 60,000 square foot of 
 office space, allowing for future expansion. The total cost including 
 land will be in the region of £5 million and will be financed 
 through a mixture of cash resources, borrowing and the exchange 
 of the Group&#146;s existing freehold building in Canterbury which 
 was purchased earlier in the year for £825,000. The offices 
 will be leased to the syndicate at a commercial rent.
 
Turnkey Management of Syndicates
 
 In March 2000, we announced our appointment by the Mitsui Marine 
 and Fire Insurance Company Limited of Japan to provide a &#145;turnkey&#146; 
 managing agency service to enable them to set up a new corporate 
 syndicate at Lloyd&#146;s. Mitsui&#146;s establishment of a new, 
 wholly corporate, syndicate at Lloyd&#146;s is indicative of the 
 confidence of the Japanese market in Lloyd&#146;s. We expect that 
 others recognising the value of the Lloyd&#146;s franchise and wishing 
 to set up new syndicates will follow Mitsui&#146;s lead. We are 
 confident that further opportunities will arise for Chaucer and 
 as such should provide a valuable source of additional income for 
 the Group.
 
Outlook
 
 We expect the motor market to show further improvement over the 
 next year. Substantial rate increases have been applied in a number 
 of areas and figures from the first quarter have improved radically 
 over those recorded a year ago.
 
 The improvements in premium rates and conditions in other markets 
 continue to relate to specific classes and are not yet widespread. 
 We will maintain our strict underwriting philosophy, so that when 
 the upturn comes we will be well placed to capitalise upon it.
