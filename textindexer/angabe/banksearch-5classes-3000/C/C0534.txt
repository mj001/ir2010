World Trade Center Losses
 
On 
 20 September 2001, the Board of Chaucer Holdings PLC estimated that, 
 in respect of the events of 11 September, the Group could incur 
 a pre-tax loss of between £8 million and £12 million, equivalent 
 to between 7p and 10p per share after tax.  It was stressed that 
 making an early estimate such as this was extremely difficult and 
 would be subject to change as further information became available.  
 The Chaucer Group has now submitted further returns to Lloyd’s and 
 is pleased to confirm that its estimates of potential Group pre-tax 
 losses from these events remain unchanged.

The forecasts are net of standard 
 personal expenses at managing agent’s level (ie after annual subscriptions, 
 levies and managing agents’ fees and commissions but before members’ 
 agents’ charges).  The forecasts are made subject to the usual caveats 
 that apply to Lloyd’s syndicate forecasts and are based on information 
 prepared for the 30 September 2001 Syndicate Returns.
