 If you wear contact lenses, then losing or damaging them can be very 
 inconvenient, particularly if you need them for studying. This special 
 Contact Lens policy from Cedar Insurance will give you the reassurance 
 you need.
 
The 
 policy covers both hard and soft lenses and a no-claims bonus operates 
 for both, reducing your renewal premium. You will need to meet part 
 of the cost of any claim &#150; the amount depends on the sum you have 
 insured. For example, for soft lenses insured for £100, the first 
 £10 per lens is excluded. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The policy covers hard or soft contact lenses against all risks of physical 
 loss or damage. Replacement is for the original prescription only. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 There are limited exclusions and some conditions e.g. if your lenses are more than one 
 year old (soft lenses) or three years old (hard lenses) 
 you may be required to supply a certificate from your optician 
 confirming 
 that your lenses were in good condition, in the event of a claim. For a full list of exclusions and conditions see the policy details.
