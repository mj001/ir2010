About MPPI
 
An MPPI policy pays your mortgage for you if you become 
 unable to work for an extended period of time, as a result 
 of redundancy, accident, sickness or disability. There are 
 also other payment protection policies that can be obtained 
 to cover credit card or loan repayments. If there is a reasonable 
 chance you will find yourself out of work in the future, 
 then this sort of policy can provide you with valuable financial 
 assistance.
 
An MPPI policy should provide enough income to cover all 
 your monthly mortgage expenses. If you have a repayment 
 mortgage, this should be your capital and interest repayment 
 and if you have an interest-only mortgage , the MPPI should 
 cover your interest payment as well as your normal monthly 
 contribution to the investment vehicle that will repay your 
 loan. 
 
Most non-mortgage PPI products are taken out for a length 
 of time that corresponds to the life of the loan it is protecting. 
 Some people cover themselves for slightly less than the 
 loan period, in the assumption that they will somehow be 
 able to make the payments for a short time, even if they 
 lose their job. Only do this if you are absolutely sure 
 that you will be able to cover your payments. Mortgage PPI 
 is usually taken out for anything from one to five years 
 at which point you can reassess and decide whether to renew 
 the policy. 
 
There is usually a deferral period - a length of time after 
 you are unable to work or make the claim before you can 
 start to receive insurance payouts. Typically this ranges 
 from 30 to 60 days, though for non-mortgage related products, 
 the deferral period can be as long as 90 or even 120 days.
