We deal with almost all of the leading 
 providers of Life Assurance and Protection 
 in the UK. They are all accessed when a full database search is 
 done for an E-mail quote. However, only some of them allow on line 
 quotes although the number is expanding. Quotes automatically have 
 a 25% commission cash back built in.
