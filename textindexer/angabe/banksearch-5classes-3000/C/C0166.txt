Doors
The final exit door from your home must be fitted with locks approved
under BS 3621.
These may be 5-lever mortise deadlocks or rimlocks.
We have shown what these locks look like.
If you regularly use more than one door as the final exit, then
both or all doors must be protected in the same way.
Acceptable locks under BS 3621 are: 
- Banham Patent Locks: S363, L111A
- Chubb: 3G114, 3G117, 3G220, 3K74, 3K77, 3C11, 3C21, 4L67
- Guardian Locks & Engineering: G5050
- NT Legge: 5511, 5512, 5641, 5642, 5761, 5762
- Josiah Parkes & Sons: 2134, 2234, 212441, 222441
- JE Reynolds: E208, E308, E210, E310
- Yale Security Products: 3000, 3020, BS1, BS2, M560, M562,
M50, M51, M52, M53, SC74, SC76, SC10 or SC12.
For UPVC and metal frame doors, it may not be possible to fit
a mortise deadlock approved under BS 3621. Your door may have
been supplied with a multi-point locking system and this may be
acceptable. We must approve these.
Bolts 
The best type of bolt is a key-operated mortise bolt set into
the wood. These can be fitted both horizontally and vertically.
For thin doors you can fit a simple bolt
to the surface of the door so that when the door is closed all
the screws are hidden. Acceptable bolts include:
- Chubb 8002 Era 838
- Ingersoll DS8V1 or ALB1 Yale
Hinge Bolts can be also added as additional security against forced
door hinges. Recommended bolts include:
- Chubb WS12, WS14
- Ingersoll HB2
All other external doors if not protected with locks approved
under BS 3621 must be fitted with key-operated bolts fitted top
and bottom to each leaf in addition to any existing lock.
Sliding patio doors 
Sliding patio doors must have key-operated security locks at the
top and bottom.
Examples of these are:
- Chubb 8K107 Copydex CS121
- Era 1001 Ingersoll PDL1
- Yale PIIA
French Doors 
French doors must have key-operated security locks at the top
or bottom. The same locks as sliding patio doors can be used.
Windows 
Any window or skylight which can be reached without using a ladder
must be fitted with key-operated locks. Acceptable window locks
are:
For wooden sash windows
- Chubb WS1
- Chubb 8013 or 8K108
- Era 822
- Ingersoll SW66
- Yale PL113
For outward opening wooden frame windows
- Chubb 8K100, 8K101 or 8K102
- Ingersoll CW67/S40
For metal frame windows
- Chubb 8012, 8K100 or 8K106
- Era 901/M
- Ingersoll CM67 or SL60
For UPVC windows 
A lot of UPVC windows have built in locks at multiple points in
the frame. These must be referred to us for acceptance.
For louvre windows 
Often the only effective security is to fit security grilles.
If you have louvre windows speak to your insurance broker or adviser.
Garage doors
 
Hinged Door Up
and over door
Up-and-over garage doors should be secured with a padlock and
pad bar as well as the lock supplied with the garage door. Make
sure the garage door is secure in case the weight of the lock
and bar pulls the door down on to someone's head.
Hinged doors to garages should be as secure as the up - and -
over door although mortise locks may be used instead of padlocks.
Remember that where the garage is built onto or connected to the
house, both the external garage door and the connecting door to
the house should be secured against burglars i.e. treated as a
final exit door where the security warranty could apply.
Other recommended locks include:
- Chubb IK12/7B020
- IK11/7009
- Ingersoll M52 Mortise lock
