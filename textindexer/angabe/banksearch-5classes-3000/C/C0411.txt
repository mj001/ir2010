	ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE LINKS WITH ISMA TO HELP MANAGE THE NATION'S STRESS
	 
	
	
	
	
	1st November 2000 - 
	 
	
	
	
	
	Research recently commissioned by the International Stress Management AssociationUK (ISMAUK) and Royal & SunAlliance (R&SA) reveals that 70% of UK adults have experienced stress at work. Nearly half (49%) of those who experienced stress at work, indicated that it had increased over the last 12 months. 
The survey, conducted to support National Stress Awareness Day&#8482; on 1st November, shows that the nightmare vision of electronic overload pushing stress levels to the limits has failed to materialise. More than half of those interviewed (52%) &#8216;disagreed strongly&#8217; that new technology was the cause of workplace stress. In fact, a third of all workers believe that their quality of life has been improved by e-technology. 
ISMA&#8217;s Carole Spiers, Chair of the National Stress Awareness Day&#8482; Committee, said: &#8220;This is the third year that we have conducted research on UK stress levels, and the figures of seven out of 10 working adults experiencing stress make shocking reading. Companies clearly have a massive problem on their hands, which they cannot afford to ignore. Unless they implement practices, policies and procedures to reduce stress, it will impact on their performance and ultimately their long-term success.&#8221; 
The pace of work and the difficulty in combining a hectic job with home life means more responsibility on employers to provide support and assistance for their employees in the form of practical measures. 31% of those surveyed admitted that they found balancing work and home life, stressful. 
Carole continued; &#8220;Technology may not be the culprit, but there are plenty of other factors that contribute to stress in the workplace. These can be work overload caused by downsizing, longer hours, bullying, pressure to perform and lack of job security. It&#8217;s exactly for this reason that we are presenting free seminars to help businesses reduce the cost of stress in the workplace.&#8221; 
The purpose of National Stress Awareness Day&#8482; (organised by ISMAUK and in its second year of sponsorship by R&SA) is to raise the issue of stress management and firmly place it on the national agenda. 
Commenting on R&SA&#8217;s sponsorship of National Stress Awareness Day&#8482;, Steve Wood, Director of Healthcare & Assistance, said: &#8220;The removal of stress is at the heart of our business and the service we provide is all about taking the stress out of everyday situations. With counselling and advice lines, R&SA provides a sympathetic ear to complement its products that protect people.&#8221; 
He concluded: &#8220;Our research shows that stress is a problem that is not going to go away unless we all pull together to identify and address the main causes. We are confident that by raising the profile of stress management that we can help clear up some of the common misconceptions that surround stress and provide some practical, preventative measures that really make a difference.&#8221; 
R&SA Healthcare & Assistance offers practical and emotional support for individuals and businesses, employers and employees, helping them to manage stress. The care package is designed to form a vital part of a company&#8217;s risk management strategy and works in close harmony with their existing Human Resources and Occupational Health functions.
