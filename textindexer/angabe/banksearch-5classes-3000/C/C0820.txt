We can help you find a mortgage
 
POIS Member Services Limited offer you a FREE service 
 that helps take the strain out of finding a mortgage.
 
 
By carrying out a computer based search we can 
 investigate the latest deals on the market, helping you to make an informed 
 choice about which mortgage may be best for you. 
 
You do not have to be moving to benefit from the 
 latest mortgage deals. 
 
We can help you review your current mortgage and 
 find new deals that may reduce your monthly repayments.
 We can also help you get a competitive quote on Buildings and Contents insurance.
