ADVICE
 TO BUSINESSES
 ON CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL ATTACK
 
 BIBA has received from the City of London
 Police the following advice to businesses on
 chemical or biological attack.
 The police have agreed that the
 advice can be given the widest possible
 circulation.
 
 Members
 may wish to circulate the information to
 their clients and to their own staff,
 although it is vital to stress that, at the
 time of writing the government assessment of
 the threat to Great Britain is 'Low'.
 
 BIBA is
 also reviewing the current position with
 regard to any insurance protection available
 under existing insurance policies of all
 classes. At
 present we are unable to offer definitive
 guidance on this, although initial
 indications are that little, if any cover is
 offered by current policies.
 We will publish advice on this issue
 following the process of consultation we are
 currently undertaking involving brokers,
 insurers and other interested parties.
 
 1. 
 Introduction
 
 1.1 
 This paper gives advice on how to
 prevent or to mitigate the
 
 effects of a chemical or biological attack
 against buildings.
 
 The advice is precautionary and follows
 recent cases of
 
 anthrax in the US. It is stressed that there
 is no evidence to
 
 suggest that any terrorist group is
 currently planning a
 
 chemical or biological attack in the UK.
 
 2. 
 The Threat
 
 
 
 2.1 
 The current government assessment of
 the threat to Great
 
 Britain from the use chemical or biological
 material is 'LOW',
 
 and this should be borne in mind when
 considering the
 
 remainder of this advice.
 
 3. 
 Prevention Advice
 
 
 
Air
 Conditioning Plant Room
 
 3.1 
 Prevent unauthorised access to main
 AC plant. Ensure all
 
 existing keys are accounted for. Change
 locks and reissue
 
 keys on a controlled basis if necessary.
 Alarm all points of
 
 access to the plant room and cover with CCTV
 for alarm 
 
 verification. Verify identity of any
 contractors working on the
 
 air conditioning and supervise whilst
 present on the premises.
 
 Air
 Conditioning Intakes
 
 3.2 
 Identify them all.
 
 3.3 
 Prevent unauthorised access, secure
 access routes and
 
 alarm with CCTV coverage for verification.
 
 On
 Site Water Storage Tanks
 
 3.4 Prevent
 unauthorised access, secure access routes
 and
 
 alarm with CCTV coverage for verification.
 
 
 
Review
 Access Control Systems
 
 3.5 Ensure
 access control is working effectively for
 staff, visitors
 
 and contractors. Passes should be worn
 visibly and a
 
 'challenge culture' adopted, to ensure only
 authorised people
 
 are on the premises.
 
 Post Room Procedures
 
 3.6 
 Review procedures for dealing with
 all mail in accordance with
 
 the advice contained in 'Bombs - Protecting
 People and
 
 Property', and in particular:
 
 3.7 
 ensure that all incoming mail,
 despatch, lorry, van and
 
 motorcycle courier deliveries, or hand
 delivered items, are
 
 processed at one single location i.e. the
 post room; 
 
 3.8 
 if available, scan or x-ray all mail.
 
 3.9 
 Check all mail for suspicious signs:
 
 
 Point
 of Origin e.g. from postmark or name of
 sender, if given.
 
 If from an unusual point or sender.
 
 
 Manuscript of Sender
 if this indicates, for example, a
 foreign
 
 style of writing, and if such is not usually
 received.
 
 
 Flap of Envelope
 - usually there is an un-gummed gap
 of
 
 about 3-5mm; if the flap of the envelope is
 stuck down
 
 completely.
 
 3.10 
 Do not open, or continue to open any
 package deemed
 
 suspicious.
 
 4. 
 Dealing with an Incident
 
 
 The following four examples will help when
 developing your
 
 contingency plans:
 
 4.1 
 Suspicious package in the post room
 
 
 Do
 not open it. Do not pass it around.
 
 If unopened, immediately place the
 suspicious package in
 
 clear sealable plastic bag, for larger
 objects use a clear 
 
 sealable plastic container.
 
 If opened leave it in situ.
 
 
 Shut windows in the post room;
 
 
 Evacuate the room, closing the door;
 
 Switch off the air conditioning system;
 
 Evacuate all the floors below the post room,
 the floor on
 
 which the post room is located and the floor
 directly above;
 
 and Dial 999 for the police, making sure you
 state you
 
 believe chemical or biological material is
 involved. 
 
 4.2 
 In addition to the above, take the
 following action if any
 
 material may have been released in the post
 room:
 
 
 Close all fire doors in the building - where
 premises have
 
 automated closing fire doors this may be
 achieved by
 
 re-configuring the fire alarm system to
 provide an additional
 
 function of automatically closing the fire
 doors without the fire
 
 alarm sounding;
 
 
 Close all windows in the rest of the
 building;
 
 
 Evacuate the building - where evacuation is
 not possible, for
 
 example where the only evacuation route is
 through the
 
 contaminated area, move staff up the
 building to await
 
 instructions from the emergency services.
 
 4.3 
 Device outside the building:
 
 
 Switch
 off the air conditioning system;
 
 Close all fire doors in the building;
 
 Close all windows in the building;
 
 Move all occupants located on the ground and
 below ground
 
 floors up the building to the first floor
 and above to await
 
 instructions from the emergency services;
 and
 
 Dial 999 for the police, making sure you
 state you believe
 
 chemical or biological material is
 involved. 
 
 4.4 
 Internal device in the entrance foyer
 (This assumes that the
 
 existing
 access control procedures limit unauthorised
 access
 
 to the entrance foyer only)
 
 
 Switch off the air conditioning system -
 this may require the
 
 installation of an isolation switch within
 the Security Control
 
 Room;
 
 Close all fire doors in the building; 
 
 Isolate the foyer - close all doors that
 give access to the foyer
 
 and close off the lifts;
 
 Close all windows in the rest of the
 building;
 
 Evacuate the building; and
 
 Dial 999 for the police, making sure you
 state you believe
 
 chemical or biological material is
 involved. 
 
 5. 
 Contaminated Persons
 
 5.1 
 The following action should be taken
 for any person 
 
 suspected of being in contact with a
 suspected chemical or
 
 biological device, prior to the arrival of
 the emergency
 
 services:
 
 5.2 
 Wash hands in a weak bleach solution
 (one teaspoonful of
 
 domestic bleach to one litre of water), and
 then rinse with
 
 ordinary soap and water; 
 
 5.3 
 Keep the person finding the device
 separate from others and
 
 available
 for immediate attention from the emergency
 
 services;
 
 
 
 5.4 
 Try to ascertain how many other
 people may have been
 
 exposed to the material - keep a detailed
 list including
 
 details of their family doctor; and
 
 5.5 
 Keep all suspected contaminated
 people separate from
 
 others.
 
 6. 
 Further Advice and Guidance
 
 6.1 
 Further advice and guidance on all
 the above can be obtained

 Counter Terrorist
 
 Crime Prevention Officer.
