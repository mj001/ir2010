	What is an ISA&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	ISA stands for Individual Savings Account. ISAs were introduced on April 6 1999. They replace PEPs and TESSAs, the tax-free plans
	which have now been phased out. ISAs enable investors shelter up to £7,000 each tax year up to and including 2005/2006 and then £5,000 each tax year thereafter. Income and gains generated from an ISA investment are exempt from UK income and capital gains tax. The Government has guaranteed that ISAs will exist until 2009 and will be reviewed in 2006. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	What are the tax benefits of ISAs&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	ISAs were designed by the Government as a tax-free investment for the public. This means that the proceeds are free of income and corporation tax.
	Savers who invest in cash ISAs are protecting the interest they earn from 20% tax - 40% if they are higher-rate taxpayers. Interest on corporate bond funds is shielded from 20% Tax. 
With equities, an investment fund will be able to reclaim 10% tax credits on share dividends until April 2004. All investors are protected from capital gains tax on the growth of their savings.
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	What will happen to friendly society tax exempt plans&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
 The introduction of ISAs does not affect friendly society tax exempt plans. To maximise your tax-free allowance, you can still take out a friendly society tax exempt plan in addition to your ISA.
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	What are the 3 components of an ISA&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
Cash - Like a building society account, but no tax on the interest.
Stocks and Shares - Individual shares or unit trusts/investment trusts or OEICs. No income or capital gains tax.
Life insurance - Most often, a with-profits savings plan. Offers more growth potential than a cash ISA but without the risk of a stockmarket investment.
 Designed first and foremost as a savings plan, usually only a notional amount of life cover is included. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	How much can I invest in each of the three components&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
This depends if you take a maxi or a mini ISA. A maxi ISA is when you take all three components out with the same provider. A mini ISA allows you to take each component out with a different provider. This limit will continue to 2005/2006. It will reduce to £5,000 in tax year 2006/2007. 
The two types of ISA work as follows: 
THE MAXI
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	Must be managed by the same company 
	
	
 
	
	
	
	
	
	 
	Until 2005/2006 
	2006/2007 onwards 
	
	
	Stocks and Shares 
	up to £7,000 
	up to £5,000 
	
	
	Cash 
	up to £3,000 
	up to £1,000 
	
	
	Insurance 
	up to £1,000 
	up to £1,000 
	
	
	TOTAL 
	up to £7,000 
	up to £5,000 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
THE MINI
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	Can open up to 3 separate ISA accounts with different managers 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	You cannot buy a mini and a maxi in the same tax year 
	
	
 
	
	
	
	
	
	 
	2001/2002 
	2006/2007 onwards 
	
	
	Stocks and Shares 
	up to £3,000 
	up to £3,000 
	
	
	Cash 
	up to £3,000 
	up to £1,000 
	
	
	Insurance 
	up to £1,000 
	up to £1,000 
	
	
	TOTAL 
	up to £7,000 
	up to £5,000 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Can you have both a mini and a maxi ISA&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
 During any one tax year you can take out 3 mini ISAs or one maxi ISA. Remember if you want to invest more than £3,000 in stocks and shares you must choose a maxi ISA.
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Can I swap from a mini to a maxi ISA&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
No, if you have bought a mini ISA you cannot decide to swap to a maxi ISA. You must wait until the beginning of the new tax year before switching. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Do I have to have all 3 parts of a maxi ISA&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
No, you can put all the money into stocks and shares. Indeed the vast majority of providers are not planning to offer the insurance component. Scottish Friendly is among the handful that are offering the insurance component as a mini ISA and as part of a maxi ISA. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Can I transfer between ISA providers&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
Yes, the transfer arrangements are more flexible than they were with Peps. With ISAs you can decide to transfer only part of your investment representing subscriptions made prior to the current tax year. If you would like to transfer an ISA started in the current tax year then you must transfer the value assets acquired or the subscriptions made in that year to the new provider. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	If I take out a maxi ISA can I move money between the cash component and the stocks and shares component&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
No, you cannot move any money between ISA components. You could however switch between unit trusts within a stocks and shares component without losing tax benefits.
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Can I withdraw money from an ISA&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
You can withdraw money from an ISA at any time. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	If I take money out of an ISA can I put it back in again&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
No, you cannot. If you put for example £3,000 in a cash ISA in the first year and after a few weeks you withdraw £500 you will not be able to put any further money into the cash ISA that year, The investment limit applies once and for all in any tax year as was the case with Peps.
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	What is the CAT standard&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
CAT stands for Charges, Access and Terms and is the Government's way to try to keep ISAs cheap and simple. Some providers' ISAs qualify for the CAT mark and some don't. Here is how an ISA qualifies for a CAT mark:
Cash ISA 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	no charges apart from fees for replacements such as duplicate cash cards or statements 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	minimum transaction size must not exceed £10 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	savers must be able to get their money out by giving no more than 7 days notice 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	interest rate no lower the 2% below bank base rates 
	
	
Stocks and Shares ISA
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	annual management charge must be no more than 1% of net asset value 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	no other charges 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	minimum monthly premium of £50.00 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	minimum lump sum investment of £500 
	
	
	 
	
	
	NB: It will be much easier for tracker funds than actively managed funds to meet these specifications. 
	
	
Insurance ISA
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	annual charge must be no more than 3% of the value of the fund 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	no other charges 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	minimum premium must be no more than £250 per year or £25 each month 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	if you decide to cash in the policy after 3 years you should get at least your premiums back 
	
	
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Does a CAT-mark give a guarantee of performance&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
No it does not. 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	Is there an age limit&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
You have to be over 18 to take out a stocks and shares or an insurance ISA. The upper age limits vary among providers. Anyone between 16 and 18 can start a cash ISA up to the £3,000 annual cash ISA limit. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Can a husband and wife both buy an ISA&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
Yes. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	What do I do when a TESSA matures&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
You can either take the cash or invest the total TESSA capital (not the interest) into a TESSA-only ISA. To be eligible for ISA inclusion, the value of the TESSA must be invested within 6 months of the maturity date. Not all providers offer a TESSA-only ISA. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Will a TESSA ISA affect other ISAs&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
No, the TESSA ISA operates independently from any other ISA you have or would like.
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	How do I decide which ISA to buy&#063; 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
There are thousands of independent financial advisers who are keen to help. Alternatively there are often adverts for free ISA guides in the financial press. 
As a general guide however:
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	Stocks and Shares = High risk / growth potential 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	Insurance = Lower risk / growth potential 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	Cash = Low risk / growth potential
