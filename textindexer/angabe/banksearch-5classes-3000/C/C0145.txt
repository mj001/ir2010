Tax-free savings 
The Scottish Bond provides an easy and straightforward way to build a tax-free&#42; cash lump sum.
The Scottish Bond not only gives peace of mind for your client in the knowledge that they are saving for their future but with built in life cover they can also be sure they are providing that little bit extra in the event of their death to help dependants through a difficult time.
*Tax free means free
of Income and Capital Gains Tax. In addition, tax credits will be received
until 5 April 2004. On maturity, proceeds are free of tax.

The minimum lump sum of £1560 provides £180 a year for 10 years - a total of £1800. The maximum lump sum for a 10-year period of £2340 actually invests £270 a year into the Scottish Bond - a total of £2700.

	Money invested in the Scottish Bond is invested in Scottish Friendly's With Profits fund. The fund is split as shown below to provide the potential for growth with an element of security.
The payout for the Scottish Bond is made up of two parts. Firstly, a sum assured that is guaranteed when the policy matures, giving security and automatic life cover.
The life cover received depends on the client's circumstances. Please contact us on 0800 834 428 or email us for a personalised sum assured.
Secondly, the main long-term growth potential comes from bonuses - these are based on the profits of Scottish Friendly. Because we're a mutual organisation, there are no shareholders to take a cut - all our profits go to our policyholders. And once they've been added, bonuses cannot be taken away.
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Current bonus rates 
	back to top 
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	 
	 
	The reversionary bonus is 1.75% of the sum assured plus 4.25% of the previously declared bonuses 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	 
	The terminal bonus is 3.5% per annum, after 7 years in force, calculated on the sum assured and previously declared bonuses.
 
	
	
	
Bonus rates are correct as at 1 April 2002 and are subject to change.
 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Consistently strong past performance

	Independent surveys show that we are flying high. Each year from 1994 to 2002, our with-profits past performance has achieved a Top Ten position in Money Management magazine's review of returns over 10 years.

Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Bonuses depend on profits yet to be earned and are not guaranteed. If you cash in an endowment savings plan before the end of the term you will be penalised. Capital values are guaranteed in building society accounts and benefit from ease of access.

If your client is keen to invest more than the £25 per month (or £270 per annum) tax exempt allowance, and is looking for a certain level of security, why not look at Scottish Friendly's Prosperity Savings Plan.
The Prosperity Savings Plan is a full cost endowment savings plan, with terms of between 10 and 35 years. If it is taken out in conjunction with a Scottish or Child Bond, the premium can be as low as £5 per month. The usual policy fee of £1 per month is split equally between the two contracts, which gives them higher sums assured than if taken out separately. In the long term, this means the policies may attract larger bonuses, as these are calculated on the sum assured. Please note that although the Prosperity Savings Plan must be taken at the same time as a tax-exempt contract for the above offer to apply, it can mature at a different time, subject to the minimum term.
If your client would like to apply for this policy package then please contact us on 0800 834 428.
If your clients already have tax exempt contracts, they can still take out a Prosperity Savings Plan on its own, but the minimum premium in this case would be £30 per month (or £230 per annum). 
Please telephone 0800 834 428 or email us for a personalised quotation and product literature.
