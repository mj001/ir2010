19. Obligations and rights when making a claim
 
 You must have an independent medical examination if we 
 believe it necessary to validate your claim (we will pay 
 the cost of the examination). If you fail or refuse to have 
 a medical examination and you do not give us a satisfactory 
 reason, we will not pay any monthly benefit.
 
 We reserve the right to contact any other person or organisation 
 that we consider necessary to assist in the validation of 
 your claim and where necessary, you must provide us with 
 the relevant authority to obtain this information. We can 
 also ask to see your personal bank or financial statements.
 
 We may arrange a personal interview with you to help you 
 look for further permanent work.
 
 We will only begin to make monthly benefit payments when 
 we receive full and satisfactory evidence of your eligibility 
 to claim. If you delay sending us the claim form or any 
 other evidence we require, your claim may be harder to check. 
 This may lead to us paying monthly benefit late or not paying 
 it at all.
