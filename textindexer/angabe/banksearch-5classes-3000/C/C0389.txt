	A tax-free gift&#42; that can grow with your child
Children grow so quickly, which means it's important to start thinking about their future when they're young. By saving from just £10 - £25 a month with Scottish Friendly's Child Bond now, you can make all the difference when they're older. For instance, helping to pay for university fees or for the deposit on a first home.

	 Lump sum funding 
	
	
This provides a way for you to take care of all your premiums at once and is especially popular with grandparents who like the reassurance of knowing all premiums for the full term of the plan are taken care of.
It works by using your lump sum to set up a funding plan which invests in Scottish Friendly's taxable fund and guarantees to pay the annual premium into your tax exempt Child Bond.
If you invest the maximum lump sum of £2340 for a 10 year period this actually invests £270 a year into the Child Bond - a total of £2700. The minimum lump sum of £1040 provides £120 a year for 10 years - a total of £1200.
If you want the payout to mature on an 18th or 21st birthday you may need the Bond to run for longer than 10 years. For example if your child is 3 on their next birthday and you would like the Bond to mature on their 18th birthday you would need a 15 year term - the maximum lump sum you could invest would be £3190. If you would like to invest a lump sum to fund a Child Bond for more than 10 years please refer to the table below for the limits.

	The Child Bond gives you the prospect of substantial growth. It also gives you the security of a guaranteed minimum payout for your child on maturity. 
	Each year, we could also add a bonus to your child's Bond. And upon maturity a terminal bonus may also be added. As a mutual organisation Scottish Friendly has no shareholders. This means that we distribute our profits among our policyholders. Your bonuses are your share of these profits. Whilst bonuses cannot be guaranteed in advance, once a bonus is added, it can never be taken away. 
	The Child Bond is a tax-free with profits savings plan. This means that, for added security, life cover is built in.
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	
	
	Consistently strong past performance

Independent surveys show we are flying high. Each year from 1994 to 2002, our with-profits past performance has achieved a Top Ten position in Money Management magazine's review of returns over 10 and 15 years.

	Please remember that past performance is not a guide to future performance. Bonuses depend on profits yet to be earned and are not guaranteed. If you cash in an endowment savings plan before the end of the term you will be penalised. Capital values are guaranteed in building society accounts and benefit from ease of access.

	The performance shows the return you could have received had it been possible to invest £25 per month tax-free starting 10 years ago.
	It has only been possible to invest £25 a month into a tax-free friendly society savings plan since 1995. Based on current tax law which may change. 
	&#42;Tax-free means free of Income and Capital Gains tax. In addition, tax credits will be received until 5 April 2004. On maturity, proceeds are free of tax.
