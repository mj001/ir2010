Bob

"The 
 last year has been an extremely productive one for Chaucer and we 
 have now put in place the foundations for the upturn in the insurance 
 cycle. We are most 
 encouraged by the evidence of improved insurance rates in our London 
 Market syndicates and the continued increases being achieved by 
 our motor syndicate.”

Chairman’s 
 Statement 
 
Results 
 
We report a loss before tax of £4.1 million for the year ended 
 31 December 2000 compared to a loss before tax of £1.1 million for 
 the previous year. Earnings 
 per share showed a loss of 7.8p (31 December 1999 -0.7p). 
 The undiluted net tangible asset value per share at 31 December 
 2000 is 71.1p (31 December 1999 - 77.6p). 
 
Your Directors have declared an unchanged final dividend for 
 the year of 1.0p net per share. 
 The dividend will be paid on 13 July 2001 to shareholders 
 on the Company’s register at close of business on 15 June 2001, 
 except that shares issued in connection with the March 2001 Placing 
 and Open Offer and Acquisition will not rank for this dividend. 
 
 
The principal constituents of the loss before taxation are

Underwriting result includes provisions in respect of early 
 estimates for the 2000 underwriting year and in respect of syndicates 
 left open from the 1996 and 1997 years. The 1998 and 1999 years 
 have not impacted on the underwriting result this year due to the 
 benefit of a stop loss policy. 
 In addition, equity markets started the year at record highs 
 and consequently we realised a loss of £1.4 million when moving 
 the balance of our equity investments into fixed interest securities 
 at the end of February 2000. 
 Our fixed interest portfolio also suffered a £1.3 million 
 unrealised loss from a widening of spreads over comparable government 
 stocks. These items 
 obscure what is otherwise a satisfactory improvement to a position 
 of surplus income over expenses. 
 
Share issue and acquisition 
 
On 9 March 2001, we announced a Placing and Open Offer of 
 33,619,489 Chaucer shares at 60p to raise £18.5 million (net of 
 expenses). In addition, 
 it was proposed to acquire a further shareholding in Chaucer Dedicated 
 for the issue of 5,650,000 Chaucer shares. 
 These proposals were approved by shareholders on 2 April 
 2001 and will place the Group in good shape to take advantage of 
 the improving insurance markets. 
 
 
Outlook
 
The year under review has seen an encouraging improvement 
 in underwriting conditions, particularly in the motor market and 
 we view prospects for the 2001 underwriting year in this sector 
 with an optimism, which has not been seen for the last five years. 
 Our other principal business areas of marine and non-marine 
 are also making good headway, although it is probably 2002 rather 
 than 2001 that will see the kind of underwriting returns that shareholders 
 should expect.

Managing Director’s Review 
 
 
 
 
Chaucer strategy and position 
 
We 
 have made further progress towards the goal of becoming an Integrated 
 Lloyd’s Vehicle based on the Chaucer managed syndicates. 
 With our joint venture company, Chaucer Dedicated Limited, 
 we now control for the 2001 underwriting year £163.3 million of 
 Chaucer syndicate capacity, representing 63.7%. 
 Following the acquisition in April 2001 of a further shareholding 
 in Chaucer Dedicated, our own underwriting interest in Chaucer syndicates 
 for the 2001 year is £107.1 million. 
 
The 
 raising of new capital in April 2001 is a very significant step 
 for the Group and will be of great benefit. 
 The majority of the funds will be used to increase the Group’s 
 underwriting participations for the 2002 underwriting year. 
 The strengthened balance sheet should also enable the Group 
 to replace existing gearing policies on more advantageous terms. 
 
 
The 
 results we are now reporting comprise a number of elements and, 
 as was explained last year, in this transitional phase from ‘spread’ 
 to ‘integrated’ underwriting, shareholders may not find the position 
 as easily understandable as a conventional insurance company. 
 For the year to 31 December 2000, we account for calendar 
 year fees, expenses and investment income and gains. 
 However in underwriting terms, we account for the results 
 of the 1998 year of account and make provisions for expected losses 
 in 1999 and 2000. Over 
 80% of underwriting participations for 1998 are based on syndicates 
 managed by third parties. 
 The position will become more transparent in subsequent years, 
 particularly as we will move to annual accounting next year. 
 A pro forma annual accounting basis of our results will be 
 included in the published accounts. 
 
Current underwriting markets 
 
Despite 
 the poor underwriting conditions that prevailed during much of 2000, 
 significant changes are finally taking place and it is with this 
 new momentum that we are optimistic for the 2001 year and beyond. 
 
 
The 
 2000 underwriting year is expected to produce a loss for the Lloyd’s 
 market and it is only the lack of catastrophes in that year that 
 will prevent market losses being in line with the 1998 and 1999 
 years of account. For 
 much of the year, the rating environment in the marine, non-marine 
 and aviation markets showed little, if any, improvement over 1999 
 and resulted in a number of syndicate cessations. 
 Motor did however continue the improvement in conditions 
 that started in 1999. 
 
The 
 renewal season for 2001 has finally confirmed that the long awaited 
 rating improvements have appeared in many classes. 
 The motor market has also continued to gather momentum and 
 is witnessing significant rate increases. The reinsurance market 
 has experienced major rate and deductible strengthening. 
 This increased cost of reinsurance protection has had the 
 effect of raising direct rates in most classes of business. 
 
The Chaucer Group, which writes across all major 
 business sectors, believes it is well positioned to benefit from 
 the upturn in the market. 
 
Results for 1998 and prior underwriting 
 years 
 
For the 1998 year, the Group underwrote £60.0 million of capacity 
 on a portfolio of 47 third party managed syndicates and, through 
 its shareholding in Chaucer Dedicated Limited, a £10.0 million interest 
 in Chaucer managed syndicates. 
 The portfolio showed a loss of 
 9.6% on capacity. We 
 have in place a stop loss policy that covers total losses in excess 
 of 5.0% of capacity up to a level of 15% and at the last year end 
 made provisions which, after deducting reinsurers’ share, amounted 
 to the policy threshold. As 
 the level of losses is within the policy limits, there is no further 
 effect on the Group’s figures. 
 Five of the Group’s 1998 participations amounting to £5.7 
 million of capacity remained open at the end of 2000 as did syndicate 
 587 in which the Group’s interest was £0.5 million through its shareholding 
 in Chaucer Dedicated Limited. 
 Any further deterioration on these open years should be contained 
 within the protection provided by the stop loss policy. 
 
The Group had one participation on a syndicate left open from 
 the 1996 year and four from 1997 which showed a deterioration of 
 £0.1 million which is charged to the 31 December 2000 result. 
 Two of these syndicates have now closed but three remain 
 open. In order to ensure, 
 so far as is possible, that these open syndicates do not have a 
 further adverse effect on future Group results, we have made a further 
 provision of £0.4 million. 
 
Forecasts for the 1999 and 2000 
 underwriting years 
 
We have received forecasts for the 1999 underwriting year 
 prepared for the Lloyd’s Syndicate Quarterly Returns at 31 December 
 2000 and have made estimates for the 2000 underwriting year from 
 our own knowledge of Chaucer managed syndicates. 
 
For the 1999 year, the Group underwrote £58.6 million of capacity, 
 of which £42.9 million was allocated to Chaucer managed syndicates 
 and £15.7 million to syndicates managed by other agents. 
 In addition, the Group had a further interest in £16.7 million 
 of Chaucer managed capacity through Chaucer Dedicated. The mid-points of the syndicate forecasts show a loss of 11.2%. 
 At the last year end, provisions were made which, after deducting 
 reinsurers’ share, amounted to the Group’s stop loss policy threshold 
 of 5.0% and, as the mid point forecasts of loss making syndicates 
 do not exceed the 15% limit of the policy, there is no further net 
 effect on the Group’s figures. 
 The further provision of £0.8 million in respect of the 1999 
 underwriting account contained in the interim statement for the 
 six months ended 30 June 2000 was unnecessary. 
 
For the 2000 year, the Group had an underwriting interest 
 in £63.1 million of capacity exclusively on the Chaucer managed 
 syndicates. In addition, 
 the Group had a further interest in £19.1 million of Chaucer managed 
 capacity through Chaucer Dedicated. 
 Early syndicate forecasts show a loss of approximately £1.6 
 million and accordingly this has been charged to the profit and 
 loss account for the year ended 31 December 2000. 
 There is no stop loss protection for the 2000 year.

The 
 1998 year of account for syndicate 587 has been left open due to 
 the uncertainty that arises pending the resolution of a reinsurance 
 dispute. The 1998 year of account loss stated above is as determined 
 at 31 December 2000 and may be subject to change depending on the 
 outcome of the dispute. The dispute involves four Australian reinsurance 
 companies and we are hopeful that the issue will be resolved in 
 2001. 
 
This 
 time last year, we resolved to address the very disappointing losses 
 that had been reported for syndicate 587’s 1997 year of account 
 and forecast for the open years. 
 Although these losses are in line with the market average 
 in the motor market, which has experienced a dreadful period of 
 underwriting losses, the Group and the syndicate resolved that the 
 situation was unacceptable. 
 
On 
 1 May 2000, Mary Towndrow, formerly deputy underwriter, was appointed 
 as Active Underwriter of the syndicate. A new divisional board, under the Chairmanship of Bob Stuchbery, 
 the Group’s Underwriting Director, was set up with the remit to 
 review every aspect of the syndicate’s activity. 
 This exercise has taken place during 2000 and each line of 
 business, claims procedure and syndicate operation has been examined 
 and where necessary either eradicated or redefined. 
 Extensive work has been carried out by external actuaries 
 and the syndicate has recruited a personal lines actuary to head 
 the new Management Information Department. 
 
We 
 are confident that the hard work undertaken over the last year has 
 placed the syndicate in a strong position whereby it will be able 
 to benefit fully from the improved trading conditions and the syndicate 
 will explore all possible avenues to ensure that in the future it 
 provides profitable returns to its capital providers. 
 
 
We 
 are pleased with the profitable result produced by our Marine syndicate 
 1084. This result compares 
 favourably with the marine market as a whole, which for the 1998 
 year of account has made a significant loss. 
 The forecast loss for the syndicate’s 1999 year is the first 
 since Hugh Hayward became active underwriter for the 1989 year. In view of the number and size of insurance catastrophes in 
 1999 and the syndicate’s large excess of loss book, the forecast 
 compares favourably with its peer group. 
 
We 
 are obviously disappointed that our Non-marine syndicate 1096 is 
 showing losses for 1998 and 1999. 
 However once again the forecasts stands up well in comparison 
 with its market peers and, to date, the syndicate is showing a good 
 progress for 2000. 
 
Chaucer 
 also managed Aviation syndicate 173, which underwrote through a 
 consortium arrangement with Amlin syndicate 2001. The 1998 result, 
 being the syndicate’s final year, is a loss of 15.6% and the year 
 of account has been reinsured to close into Amlin’s syndicate 2001. 
 
 
Quota Share Reinsurance arrangements 
 
 
In May 2000, we entered into a capital provision quota share 
 reinsurance arrangement with Zurich Insurance Company whereby Zurich 
 agreed to procure the provision of a £4.95 million letter of credit 
 as funds at Lloyd’s for Chaucer Holdings. 
 In return the Group has agreed to pay to Zurich the profits 
 (or receive compensation for losses) on an £11.0 million underwriting 
 line on syndicate 587 for the 2000 year of account. 
 This arrangement enabled the Group to substitute the letter 
 of credit for investments of comparable value which were deposited 
 at Lloyd’s. The investments 
 were then sold and the proceeds have been used to complete the financing 
 of the freehold building at Whitstable and the balance used to pay 
 underwriting losses. The 
 arrangement has continued for the 2001 year with an increased Letter 
 of Credit of £6.0 million supporting capacity of £15.0 million on 
 syndicate 587. 
 
In November 2000, we entered into a similar capital provision 
 quota share reinsurance arrangement with Labuan Re for the 2001 
 year of account whereby Labuan agreed to procure the provision of 
 an £8.0 million letter of credit as funds at Lloyd’s for Chaucer 
 Holdings. In return the Group has agreed to pay to Labuan the profits 
 (or receive compensation for losses) on a £6.0 million underwriting 
 line on syndicate 587, £4.0 million on syndicate 1084 and £10.0 
 million on syndicate 1096 for the 2001 year of account. 
 
Syndicate 587 office 
 
The new 35,000 square foot Whitstable office for the motor 
 syndicate was completed at the end of August 2000. 
 It is a great tribute to all those involved that this large 
 and complex project was completed on time. 
 Operating the syndicate from a single modern building should 
 greatly aid efficiency, management and staff retention. 
 The Group’s existing freehold building in Canterbury was 
 sold to the developer as part of the transaction. 
 
Third party management of syndicates 
 
In March 2000, we announced our appointment by the Mitsui 
 Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited of Japan to provide a 
 managing agency service to enable them to set up a new corporate 
 syndicate at Lloyd’s which commenced business on 1 April 2000. 
 In June 2000, we were appointed by Sorema SA, to provide 
 a similar service for their new corporate syndicate which commenced 
 business on 1 July 2000. These 
 new syndicates are important indications of the confidence of major 
 overseas insurance companies in Lloyd’s and Chaucer. 
 These management contracts provide useful additional income 
 and overhead absorption for the Chaucer Group. 
 
 
Investments 
 
The investment portfolio at 1 January 2000 comprised 15.1 
 million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and 88.6 million 
 units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust. 
 At the end of February 2000, in order to generate more income 
 and to reduce volatility, we decided to sell the Company’s remaining 
 holding of Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust (realising a loss of £1.4 
 million) and invest the proceeds of £13.3 million in the Aberdeen 
 High Yield Bond Unit Trust. 
 
In May and early June as a result of the substitution of the 
 £4.95 million letter of credit for investments 
 referred to above, we sold 17.2 million units in the Aberdeen 
 Fixed Interest Unit Trust. 
 The Company’s investments now comprise 71.7 million units 
 in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust and 13.4 million units 
 in the Aberdeen High Yield Bond Unit Trust. 
 
Chaucer managed capacity in 2001 
 
 
Managed capacity on our own syndicates for 2001 remains approximately 
 the same as for 2000 although the balance has altered.

Chaucer Consortium Underwriting 
 Limited 
 
In September 2000 we announced the launch of Chaucer Consortium Underwriting 
 Limited ("CCUL”) to manage consortium arrangements, both for Lloyd’s 
 syndicates (including those managed by Chaucer) and Treasury approved 
 insurance companies.
 CCUL commenced operations for the 2001 year of account and now manages 
 approximately US$11 million of premium income covering personal 
 accident and space risks. 
 This is down from earlier estimates and we are hopeful that 
 capacity will increase significantly for next year. 
 The company is fifty one per cent owned by Chaucer, with 
 the balance being held by CCUL management. 
 
Outlook 
 
We have been reporting encouraging improvements in the motor market for 
 some while and these continue to show in our monthly figures. 
 The 2001 renewal season is however the first time that 
 we have experienced good evidence of a turn in our other two principal 
 markets of marine and non-marine. 
 We believe that Chaucer is well positioned to 
 benefit from the upturn in the market and view the future with confidence.
