 Declaration
 "To 
 the best of my knowledge and belief all the persons to be insured and 
 those persons on whose state of health the proposed holiday(s)/journey(s) 
 depend are in good physical and mental health and free from physical defect 
 or infirmity.I acknowledge that in the event of a claim all persons to 
 be insured will not be covered for any pre-existing health condition which 
 existed prior to the inception of this policy. I am not aware of any reason 
 for a proposed holiday/journey to be cancelled or curtailed and I have 
 not withheld any Material Facts. I understand non disclosure or misrepresentation 
 of a Material Fact will entitle the Underwriters to void the insurance. 
 A Material Fact is one likely to influence the acceptance or assessment 
 of this proposal by the Underwriters. If you are in any doubt as to what 
 constitutes a Material Fact you should consult POIS Member Services Ltd 
 at the address and telephone number given. I understand that, in respect 
 of medical expenses, cancellation and curtailment all persons aged between 
 61 and 75 years inclusive will be liable for 20% of all amounts claimed 
 to a maximum of £1,000 in addition to any other excess hereunder. All 
 persons to be insured are resident in the United Kingdom."
