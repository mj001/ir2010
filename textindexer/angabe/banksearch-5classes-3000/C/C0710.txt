	ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE TARGETS IFA'S WITH NEW 'LIFESTYLE'

	Royal & SunAlliance, winner of Standard & Poor&#8217;s Best UK Investment Management Group for the last three years, has today unveiled details of its next generation investment bond, available from 29 January 2001, offering IFAs and their clients the ultimate in choice, flexibility and performance. 
Lifestyle Bond builds on the strengths of Royal & SunAlliance&#8217;s existing investment bond range, updating them with a new single, fully flexible product with twenty fund options including with profits, unit linked and income distribution. 
The new bond has been designed to adapt to customers&#8217; changing needs and lifestyles, allowing up to twelve penalty-free fund switches each year. The product offers flexible income options, including the unique opportunity to reinvest with profits bonuses in the client&#8217;s chosen unit linked fund. This unique feature enables IFAs and their clients to create a cost-effective phased investment plan, where the foundation is a lower risk with profits fund, by allowing bonuses to be reinvested in a diverse range of funds from Cautious Managed through to the specialist EuroTech. 
Withdrawals of up to 7.5% per annum can be taken on a regular basis, either monthly, quarterly, termly, half-yearly or yearly and can be based purely on the annual bonus element. 
For the unit linked and income distribution funds there is a single annual administration charge of 1.25%. As a loyalty reward, this charge reduces to 1% from the sixth year onwards. The with profits fund has no explicit charges, expenses are taken into account when setting the bonus rates. Commenting, Mark Edwards, IFA Personal Market Leader, said: &#8220;The popularity of with profit bonds has soared in recent years and Royal & SunAlliance has been a leader in this market. We also believe other types of investment bonds will play an increasing role in clients&#8217; investment portfolios and the freedom to choose is a key factor in the design of Lifestyle Bond. 
&#8220;Research amongst IFAs told us they wanted the ability to switch their clients&#8217; funds more easily between with profits and unit linked. By combining our award-winning fund range in one product, IFAs can reflect the level of risk for each individual client. Using our flexible penalty-free switching facility IFAs can adjust their client&#8217;s portfolio as circumstances change. 
&#8220;Lifestyle Bond builds on our investment expertise and is another key element in our IFA product range. We believe there is also an excellent opportunity for IFAs to widen the traditional target market for investment bonds to include younger ages without alienating traditional purchasers. 
&#8220;Looking to the future we have developed a set of commission options offering flexibility for the IFA, and together with our allocation rates, charges and award winning investment performance, we believe we have a product that is a winner for both IFAs and their clients.&#8221; 
This investment bond is also designed to operate in the specialist inheritance tax and trustee investment markets. 
Details of Royal & SunAlliance&#8217;s new Lifestyle Investment Bond are available to IFAs via their usual Royal & SunAlliance Consultant or by phoning 08457 660 966
