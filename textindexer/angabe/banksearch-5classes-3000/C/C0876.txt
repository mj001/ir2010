	EMPLOYERS FAIL TO ADDRESS IMPACT OF LONG HOURS CULTURE AS WORKPLACE STRESS HITS OVER HALF THE UK WORKFORCE

	British business is failing to address the implications of a 24/7 work culture in the UK and the impact of work related stress, according to new research released today by the International Stress Management Association (ISMA) and Royal & SunAlliance. 
The report reveals that more than half (53%) of the UK&#8217;s workforce is suffering from workplace stress as the working week rises to more than five days for one in four employees across the nation. Surprisingly, it is Yorkshire and not the City of London that is the stress capital of the UK. 
The report &#8211; commissioned to mark National Stress Awareness Day today (7 November) which is organised by ISMA and sponsored by Royal & SunAlliance &#8211; reveals that other catalysts of workplace stress include deadline pressures (cited by 62%), an unsupportive work environment (40%) and problems with maintaining an acceptable work/ life balance (also 40%). 
And while one in two of today&#8217;s workforce have suffered from stress at work during the last 12 months, the report shows that, significantly, one in four have needed time off as a result. Two thirds (65%) of stressed workers feel it is reducing their job satisfaction and 41% say it is lowering their productivity. 
The report reveals the full scale of the British business mentality for long working hours with one in four employees now working more than five days a week. A third of these are actually working over the Government guideline stating that personnel should not work more than 48 hours a week. 
Some 54% say they work these hours because their employer requires them to do so. It is therefore not surprising that simply too much work is the most common cause of stress, with almost three quarters (72%) citing this as the main reason. 
Workers in Yorkshire are the most under pressure with people there most likely to work both the longest hours and over a five day week. However, workers in the region are prepared to soldier on and are least likely (9%) to have taken time off as a result of stress, compared to the national average of 24%. 
In contrast, people living in the North East and the East Midlands are least likely to have suffered from workplace stress during the past 12 months, while people in Scotland are least likely to work more than five days a week. 
The findings have prompted a stark warning to the nation&#8217;s employers from stress expert Professor Cary Cooper CBE, ISMA President and Deputy Vice Chancellor of UMIST*, who said: &#8220;Now we are going through an economic downturn, UK plc cannot afford poor productivity. Managing people effectively is fundamentally more important than introducing new technology. Employers are always saying that people are their most valuable resource and it&#8217;s time they stopped talking and did something about it&#8221;. 
Linda McCormack, Consumer Spokesperson for Royal & SunAlliance, commented: &#8220;The research results should be seen as a wake-up call for the nation&#8217;s employers, who should be seriously worried when such a large proportion of the workforce say they are suffering from work-related stress. It is clearly a growing problem, which businesses need to tackle sooner rather than later&#8221;.
