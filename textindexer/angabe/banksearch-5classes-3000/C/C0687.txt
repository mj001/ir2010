Features 
 and Product Description
 
 
- You can save 
 a lot of money by increasing the deferred period if you can manage without 
 receiving income for a longer period of time.
 
- Check the 
 cost every couple of years as premiums are adjusted from time to time. 
 Also an aggressive newcomer trying to buy market share may be cheaper 
 than your current provider (even if you are older than when you started 
 the cover). With non investment / profit linked contracts you have no 
 termination costs or losses in swapping companies just as you would 
 when buying car insurance.
 
- Income Protection is also known as Permanent Health 
 Insurance or PHI
