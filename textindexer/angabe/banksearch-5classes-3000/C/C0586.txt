Shareholder FAQS
How do I change my home address on my share certificate? 
You should notify Lloyds TSB Registrars in writing.
If you hold shares in joint names, the notification to change address must be signed by the
first named shareholder.
 
What do I do to change my name or get married? 
You should notify Lloyds TSB in writing of any change to your name, providing documentary evidence, such as a copy of your marriage certificate or change of name by deed poll and enclose your share certificate for amendment.
If you need un-cashed dividend cheques to be reissued in your new name, please also include them in your envelope.
 
My share certificate has been lost or stolen. What should I do? 
If you lose your share certificate, or it has been stolen, you should inform Lloyds TSB Registrars immediately by telephoning them on 0870 6000190.
A record of the missing share certificate will be made to prevent it being used and a letter of indemnity will be sent to you to sign. In signing this indemnity, you are confirming that if the missing share certificate subsequently comes to light, you will return it to Lloyds TSB Registrars to be cancelled. This is to protect Prudential from possible misuse of your certificate while it is not in your possession. A replacement certificate will then be sent to you.
There is a charge for this service, so we advise you to keep your share certificates in a safe and secure place.
 
Can I have my dividends paid directly into my bank or building society account? 
Yes, providing you have forwarded the relevant documentation to Lloyds TSB Registrars. If you wish to receive your dividends this ways, please contact Lloyds TSB Registrars who will send you the relevant documentation.
Payment of dividends in this way avoids the risk of loss in the post, or otherwise. It also saves you the trouble of taking or sending cheques to your bank or building society, avoids delays as the dividends are credited on the due date and you will still receive the tax credit voucher at your registered address. 
I haven't received my last dividend cheque. What should I do? 
Please contact Lloyds TSB Registrars, who will investigate the reason for non-receipt.
You may wish to have future dividends paid directly into your bank or building society account.
See above for details.
 
I have found an out of date dividend cheque. What can I do? 
Prudential dividend cheques may be cashed within twelve months of issue. After this time they need to be reissued. You can do this by returning the cheque to Lloyds TSB Registrars. To avoid this problem, you should consider having your dividend cheques paid directly into your bank or building society account. See above for details. 
Can I take my dividend in shares? 
Prudential currently operates a scrip dividend scheme which enables you to increase your shareholding in Prudential plc by electing for your dividends to be paid in shares. On each occasion when the directors agree to offer the scrip dividend alternative to shareholders, Lloyds TSB Registrars will provide you with the necessary form for completion. 
I am receiving two sets of Prudential communications. How can I stop this? 
Sometimes if shares are bought at different times the registration details given to Lloyds TSB Registrars might differ slightly on each occasion (e.g. Mr Luke S Whyte or Mr Luke Whyte). This can result in our Registrar opening two accounts with slightly different details. This in turn leads to a dividend cheque being issued in respect of each account each time a dividend is paid, and the duplication of other shareholder communications.
If your shareholding is duplicated in this way, please contact Lloyds TSB Registrars who will send you an account combination form for you to complete and return to them. 
When is the next dividend paid? 
Prudential normally pays dividends twice a year, usually in May and November. 
My partner, or relative, has passed away. What should I do about their shareholding? 
Please contact Lloyds TSB Registrars at your earliest opportunity. They will assist you with the documentation required and be able to make the process as straightforward as possible for you. 
How do I transfer my shares? 
At some point you may wish to transfer some or all of your shares to someone else (for example your partner or a member of your family). To do this you will need to complete a share transfer form, which is available from Lloyds TSB Registrars.
The form should be fully completed and returned with your share certificate representing at least the number of shares being transferred. Lloyds TSB Registrars will then process the transfer and issue a balance share certificate to you if applicable. Lloyds TSB Registrars will be able to help you with any questions you may have about completing the form. 
How can I check my register details? 
You can log onto www.shareview.co.uk where you will be able to check your details, including your shareholding, dividend payments and various transactions.
The service is secure, free and easy to use. You will need your shareholder reference number to access this service: this can be found on your share certificate or from a dividend tax counterfoil. You will be asked to select your own PIN and a user ID will be posted to you.
 
How do I buy and sell Prudential plc shares? 
You can do this through a stockbroker or your bank. Stockbrokers Cazenove & Co offer a postal sharedealing service to Prudential shareholders at competitive commission rates. For details telephone 020 7606 1768 or write to 12 Tokenhouse Yard, London EC2R 7AN.
