The
 latest news and information
 
 Dear
 Member
 Welcome
 to the new broker section of the website. It represents a
 major step forward for members, because it is exclusively for
 you.
 
It
 has everything and more that you'd expect from the UK's
 leading insurance organisation. You'll find details of BIBA's
 schemes, facilities, advice services and helplines. Plus
 information about training courses, the latest industry and
 BIBA news and the full range of products created to give you a
 competitive edge.
 Watch
 out too for some important new schemes and the launch of a new
 bulletin board, where you can express your views, communicate
 with other members and ask questions.
 
We
 hope you enjoy the Members Only section, which we aim to keep
 interesting and informative. If you have any comments or
 suggestions, please contact me at wellerj@biba.org.uk
 I
 look forward to hearing from you.
