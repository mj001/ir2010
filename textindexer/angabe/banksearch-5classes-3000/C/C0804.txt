FLOODING
 - A MESSAGE FROM THE BRITISH INSURANCE
 BROKERS' ASSOCIATION
 
 
 
Following
 the weekend of extensive flooding, the
 British Insurance Brokers'
 Association (BIBA) has this morning issued
 the following statement and advice to those
 hit.
 
Even
 prior to this weekend, it is thought that
 flood damage to homes and businesses
 has cost insurers over £500 million during
 the last three years. The flooding in the UK over the past weekend and that
 which is expected
 still to come,
 will add considerably to this figure
 and is bound to
 have a knock on effect on household
 insurance premiums in coming years.
 
 
 
BIBA
 is advising people caught in the recent
 flooding to take note of the following
 advice before acting and sanctioning
 repair work: 
 
 
 
§ Temporary
 emergency repairs at a reasonable cost
 should be paid by the insurers, but make
 sure you keep all of your receipts.
 
§ 
 As
 long as you have an up-to-date household
 buildings and contents policy, you should be
 covered against damage by flood.
 Many business policies also cover
 damage by flood. 
 
§ 
 If
 your car has suffered as a result of the
 flooding, this should be covered by a
 comprehensive motor policy. 
 
§ If
 your home has been made uninhabitable, the
 reasonable cost of alternative accommodation will usually be met up to stated
 limits by your
 insurer. 
 
 
 
§ 
 You
 should always try to salvage your belongings
 but without putting yourself at personal risk. 
 
§ Contact
 your insurance company, broker or agent as
 soon as possible for
 advice on how to progress your claim. 
 
Mike
 Williams, BIBA Chief Executive said,
 "Each year millions of people are potentially at risk from flooding and each year many fall
 victim to 
 
 swelling rivers or full blown flooding.
 There is nothing any of us can do about the forces of nature but we can all act to reduce the
 potential
 damage. 
 It is worrying to think that some
 people living in flood-prone areas continue
 to live without adequate insurance
 protection against damage,
 not only to their buildings but to their
 contents too.
 
 
 
'Anyone
 living in a flood-prone area should contact
 their local broker who will have specialist
 knowledge about insurance products that may
 specialise in the
 exact form of protection they require."
 
 
 
There
 is a possibility of further flooding in the
 UK and BIBA is advising those
 in flood-prone areas to reduce the risk of
 flood damage by: 
 
§ contacting
 your insurance company as soon as possible,
 as they can often offer helpful advice in this situation to help you to reduce
 the possibility of the damage getting any worse; 
 
§ moving
 as much as possible upstairs as soon as you
 hear the flood alert;
 
§ remembering
 that doors and windows may be swollen tight
 and floors may bulge, therefore making buildings unsafe following a
 flood;
 
§ electricity
 and gas should not be used and mains
 drinking water should not be consumed as it
 may have become contaminated;
 
 
§ leaving
 windows, doors and built-in cupboards open
 and keeping rooms heated where
 possible; 
 
§ pulling
 furniture away from walls and oiling all
 hinges and locks to prevent them
 corroding; 
 
§ drying
 out a building can take months so don't be
 in a hurry to redecorate; 
 
 
§ treating
 walls with an anti-mould solution before
 decorating; 
 
§ make
 sure you keep a copy of important telephone
 numbers and policy documents in an easily accessible place in case you require
 them following a flood.
