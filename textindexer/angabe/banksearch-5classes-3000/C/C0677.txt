If you need 
 a sum of money for an emergency?
 
If you have a with-profits policy, a policy loan can be taken 
 out as an alternative to surrendering your policy. The loan available depends 
 on the surrender value of your policy. Taking out a loan will not effect the 
 bonuses added to your with-profits policy. 
 
Please note - policy loans are not available for unit-linked 
 policies. If you are in any doubt as to whether a loan is available on your 
 policy, please call Customer Services for details
