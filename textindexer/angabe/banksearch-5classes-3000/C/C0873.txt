A Friendly Society you can trust
 
POIS Assurance is now part of Family Assurance Friendly Society 
 Limited, and as such brings its members the benefits and security of being 
 part of the UK&#146;s largest tax-exempt friendly society, with over 500,000 
 members and over £1.5 billion of funds under management (as at February 
 2002).
 
POIS Assurance has a history of providing our members with good 
 value protection and secure and profitable savings. The partnership with Family 
 means that we can not only continue with this but also offer our customers 
 a wider choice of options for their financial planning and bring them value 
 for money, quality products. 
 
We welcome the continued interest from employees of the Royal 
 Mail, BT and the Civil Service. 
 
The benefits of Membership
 
Friendly Societies are "mutual" companies, which means 
 we do not have any shareholders - Members share directly in the performance 
 of the Society. And what&#146;s more your investments in our tax exempt savings 
 plans will benefit from being free of Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax. 
 
Deductions from pay
 
If you wish, and provided your employer allows, your monthly 
 premium can be paid in weekly instalments by having deductions made automatically 
 from your pay or pension - a convenient benefit for many of our Members.
