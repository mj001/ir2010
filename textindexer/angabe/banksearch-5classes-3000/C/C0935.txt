'ADDICTED TO SAVING'
 5th March 2002
 
 
 National No Smoking Day takes place on Wed 13 March. This could be a really good time to think about giving up and looking to the future. Giving up an expensive habit, like smoking, can leave us with money available to us which could help to provide for retirement and improve the quality of life in old age, says leading pension provider, 
 Co-operative Insurance Society (CIS). 
 
 "Many people give something up at this time of year, and it can be the ideal time to think about your future and what you want to achieve," says Martin Clarke, General Manager, Marketing, "Someone with enough willpower to give up an addictive habit like smoking can certainly take charge of their own financial destiny and save for retirement. This will not only have possible health benefits but may help people to enjoy a longer and better quality of life in retirement." 
 
 At approx £4.20 a packet, multiply that by the amount of cigarettes you smoke per month and see what you could save for your retirement:

 The figures are only examples and cannot be guaranteed and you could get back more or less than the figures quoted. 
 
 The monthly premiums quoted are net of tax relief at the basic rate. 
 
 The pension figures given in the examples assume the investment grows each year at 7% and a full pension is taken. 
 
 The figures assume that the pension: 
 
- Stays the same from the time you start taking it 
 
- Is paid at the beginning of each month for a minimum of 5 years from when you retire 
 
- Does not include a spouses pension 
 Your pension income will depend on how your investments grow and interest rates at the time you retire.
