The 
 Uni-Shield policy from Saxon is made up of various components: Fee and 
 Loan Shield, Parent Shield and Sports Shield which you can pick and mix 
 as you like!
	
	
- Fee and 
 Loan Shield (from £11.94 per month)&#150; protect you from being 
 liable to pay accommodation charges, tuition fees and student loans 
 if you leave college or uni before the end of your course, for any 
 reason other than a change of heart (including exam failure, lack 
 of funds and the most common reason - STRESS). ITS A SAD FACT BUT 
 ON AVERAGE 21% OF STUDENTS DO NOT FINISH THEIR COURSE.
	
- Parent 
 Shield (from £15.97 a month)&#150; if one of your parents loses their 
 job or cannot work, while you are at college or university, this policy 
 could provide you with up to £300 per month towards your tuition 
 and accommodation fees.
	
- Sports 
 Shield (from £2.63 a month)&#150; this provides personal injury cover 
 against most sports and pastimes.
	
	
It&#146;s 
 a great idea to tell your parents about these policies as the reality 
 is that they could be the ones who end up forking out if you are injured 
 playing sport or have to drop out of your course for some reason.
