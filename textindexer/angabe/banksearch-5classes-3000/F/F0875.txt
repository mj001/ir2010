Hello,
Can someone please tell me how to pass array control to a function in VB.
This is what I want to do. I want to write a function which loads a shape with index. Then I would like to re-use that code to load several shapes:
I think a part of the code should look like this....
1) code for the function:
public function load_shape(shape,n)
for i=1 to n
load shape(i)
....
next i
2) code to call function:
load_shape(shp1,5)
Who can help me?
Thanks Leonardo
