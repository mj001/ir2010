About VBDOGs
Visual Basic Developers On-Line Group 
(VBDOGs) is a
Toronto-based user group that is focused on sharing information and promoting knowledge
about software development in Visual Basic and .NET environment. Our group is relatively
small (between 70 and 80 members) and it consists of mostly contract
and professional developers, but we welcome members of all backgrounds. There is
no membership fee. 
The group meets once a month at one of the
member's homes and we usually get between 10 to 20 members at a meeting. Meetings
are informal and allow for participation by everyone. They consist of discussions of
current VB, Microsoft, competitive and add-on tool issues. There is often discussion on
professional issues about contracts and salaries, etc. 
In between the meetings, the members
frequently chat through e-mail using our private list server. In order to participate
in conversations on-line, you will have to become a member and be added to the list. 
We find this list very useful for posting technical questions and sharing information on
new job opportunities.
If you are in the Toronto area and are
interested in finding out more about becoming a VBDOG, send your VBDOG membership
information request to: Dwayne Lamb.
