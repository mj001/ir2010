 WBPidlNav: How to navigate the
 WebBrowser control using a folder's pidl
 
 Ever wanted to navigate the IE4 WebBrowser control to a local system folder that has no
 path? How about the Desktop or Network Neighborhood virtual folders? 
This example simply demonstrates how to obtain a specified special
 folder's pidl (pointer to an item ID list) from the SHGetSpecialFolderLocation API, obtain
 the region in memory that pidl's data resides, copy the pidl's data to a VB allocated byte
 array, and finally navigate the WebBrowser to specified special folder by passing the byte
 array in a VB Variant variable (creating a SAFEARRAY) to the WebBrowser's Navigate2
 method..
 
For more information on the WebBrowser's Navigate2 method
 and SAFEARRAYs, see MS KB article ID Q167834 "HOWTO: Web Browser Navigation Using a
 PIDL" (included)
