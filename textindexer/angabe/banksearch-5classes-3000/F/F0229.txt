This is the new look vbuniverse. We
 have a new address, vbuniverse.co.uk, as you can see. I have had many people asking me why
 I moved vbuniverse. There are two main reasons for this. The first was the need for a
 domain name, an easy address to remember - vbuniverse.co.uk. The second was really the
 most important. Up until a few weeks ago I was happy with my previous host, webhostme.com.
 One of the reasons I became a member for webhostme.com was their promise of no
 advertising, no banners, no nothing. Unfortunately recently they have decided to place a
 script at the end of each HTML document for a popup window advert. This meant, due to my
 use of frames, adverts were all over the place.
I gave the site a whole new look because I realised that the old site
 format was not as userfriendly as I would have liked. As you can see I have used various
 VBScript scripts to give the site a more welcoming layout. I have also decided to clean
 the site up abit, less adverts etc. On the whole, the site is a lot more simlpe and easier
 to navigate. I you have any comments on the new look or another related subject please use
 our comments page.
 
Note: If you would like any material from the old
 site, which is not available here, please e-mail me: rhtj@Yahoo.com.
