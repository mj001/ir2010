Record/Play Sound
Tip by Sabu
 
Tip description 
 
This is a very simple yet affective example, this example shows you how to record then play your chosen sounds, but you can go over the limit of this example and even create a sound recorder that can save onto sound formats. 
 
Tip Code 
 
Declare Function mciSendString Lib "winmm.dll" _
 Alias "mciSendStringA" _
 (ByVal lpstrCommand As String, _ 
 ByVal lpstrReturnString As String, _ 
 ByVal uReturnLength As Long, _
 ByVal hwndCallback As Long) As Long
Declare Function mciGetErrorString Lib "winmm.dll" _ 
 Alias "mciGetErrorStringA" _ 
 (ByVal dwError As Long, _ 
 ByVal lpstrBuffer As String, _ 
 ByVal uLength As Long) As Long
Sub CloseSound()
 Dim Result&
 Dim errormsg%
 Dim ReturnString As String * 1024
 Dim ErrorString As String * 1024
 Result& = mciSendString("close mysound", ReturnString, 1024, 0)
End Su
ub RecordSound()
'records sound aliased as mysound to memory for six seconds
 Dim Result&
 Dim errormsg%
 Dim ReturnString As String * 1024
 Dim ErrorString As String * 1024
 CloseSound
 Result& = mciSendString("open new type waveaudio alias mysound", ReturnString, 1024, 0)
 If Not Result& = 0 Then
 errormsg% = mciGetErrorString(Result&, ErrorString, 1024)
 MsgBox ErrorString, 0, "Error"
 Exit Sub
 End If
 Result& = mciSendString("set mysound time format ms bitspersample 8 samplespersec 11025", ReturnString, 1024, 0)
 If Not Result& = 0 Then
 errormsg% = mciGetErrorString(Result&, ErrorString, 1024)
 MsgBox ErrorString, 0, "Error"
 Exit Sub
 End If
'Record for 60000 milliseconds
 Result& = mciSendString("record mysound to 60000", ReturnString, 1024, 0)
 If Not Result& = 0 Then
 errormsg% = mciGetErrorString(Result&, ErrorString, 1024)
 MsgBox ErrorString, 0, "Error"
 Exit Sub
 End If
End Sub
Sub PlayRecSound()
'plays the recoreded sound aliased by mysound
 Dim Result&
 Dim errormsg%
 Dim ReturnString As String * 1024
 Dim ErrorString As String * 1024
 Result& = mciSendString("stop mysound", ReturnString, 1024, 0)
 If Not Result& = 0 Then
 errormsg% = mciGetErrorString(Result&, ErrorString, 1024)
 MsgBox ErrorString, 0, "Error"
 End If
 
 Result& = mciSendString("play mysound from 1 wait", ReturnString, 1024, 0)
 If Not Result& = 0 Then
 errormsg% = mciGetErrorString(Result&, ErrorString, 1024)
 MsgBox ErrorString, 0, "Error"
 End If
 
End Su
Private Sub Command1_Click()
RecordSound
End Sub
Private Sub Command2_Click()
Call PlayRecSound
