Speech
Graham Parker VBUG Chairman
We all want to make the transition to 
Component Based Software Development - don't we? Does it mean re-writing the 
applications we already have or developing new applications as distributed 
components across a network? Does it mean we use the tools of today or the tools 
of tomorrow? Perhaps some of both. Graham opens the whole debate with a look 
into the Visual Studio 6.0 release and asks will it help us produce better 
n-tier Applications.
SQL Server 7 
Development with VB6
Bill Vaughn - Visual Studio Enterprise Product Manager 
for Microsoft
SQL Server 7 is just over the horizon. Is 
your Visual Basic application designed to take advantage of its new features? 
Are you writing code today that will be made unnecessary or outdated by the SQL 
Server team? This session walks you through the new SQL Server 7 feature set and 
focuses on a number of innovations that should make your Visual Basic 
applications faster, easier to write, deploy and support.
Databases Are For 
Dorks (Data Access in VB6)
Lawson Davies - TMS
Getting the Best from Visual Basic 6.0's 
Data Access: Visual Basic 6.0 introduces radical changes to its data access 
paradigms. This session will look at the inclusions of ADO 2.0, the Data 
Environment and the ability to create custom data consumers and providers. It 
will consider the impact on DAO and RDO, and what the changes mean to tiered 
architectures and middle-tier objects.
Programming the MS Agent Control and Speech Recognition
Steve Moulton - Mollysoft Consulting
The Microsoft Agent is a new fun piece of 
technology. Steve will talk to a number of different agents, show you how to 
control them, to program them and to interact with them. But you don't have to 
let these agents 'eat your lunch-time' - we've made it optional.
Web.VB6.Easy (Active Web Content using Visual Basic 6.0)
Mike Shammas - VB Lecturer and 
Product Manager, QA Training.
We will create from scratch a web site that 
users may navigate and query, but without a line of script or ASP code. Using 
VB6 we will code and debug that web site using objects and events. We will also 
examine how VB6 can create Dynamic HTML pages for client side coding and 
debugging. Not bad for an hour's work!
Three Tier Client Server In A 
Lunchtime
David Sussman - Developer and Author 
 
Fed up of talk about n-tier client server 
systems? Feel you're being left out? Don't know what COM is? Although still a 
relatively new technology for Microsoft, MTS has brought the realm of 
distributed application development within the grasp of a large proportion of 
the programmer community, who felt their skill were being left behind. This talk 
will show you how to build a 3-tier application complete with transactions and 
error handling.
