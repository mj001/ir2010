Visual Basic: The User Interface
The User Interface: the Form Window
A form is a "container" for custom controls. Controls can be "drawn" anywhere within the form. When compiled a form becomes a ordinary window that can be manipulated within the Microsoft Windows environment. It is the interaction between the forms, controls and the underlying code that creates a working window application.
Miscellaneous Information
The dots within the form, form a grid that is useful for aligning controls. The size of the grid and whether controls are aligned at all can be control from the Options|Environment.. menu.
Also like all controls the Property Name is set to a default. In this case Form1.
