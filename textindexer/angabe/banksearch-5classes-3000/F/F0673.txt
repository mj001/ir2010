	Janus GridEX 
	 
	The Mercedes of Grid Controls 
	From Janus Systems 
	 
	
 
The Janus GridEX 2000 (also known as Version 2.0) is a 32-bit ActiveX grid control designed to display and manipulate data using an easy and intuitive user interface patterned after Microsoft Outlook. Janus GridEX 2000, has built-in multilingual sorting capabilities, the columns can be sorted as strings, numbers or dates (even while grouped). With the unique grouping capability of the control, a user can drag a column header and drop it into the "Group By Box" and the control automatically presents the data grouped by the chosen field. When a record is added or updated, the control places that record in its proper position based on the current group/sort settings.

If You've Seen One Grid, You've Seen 'em All
I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty tired of all the grids out there. It seems like someone comes out with a new grid at least once a month. So I was a bit skeptical about the newest grid control from Janus Systems. And boy was I wrong. 
The New Car Show
 Once you start using The Janus GridEX 2000 you'll start to feel like you're at the new car show. You know - the show that has all those concept cars that look so cool. The difference is that the concept cars are just teasers, you can look but you can't buy. The Janus GridEX 2000 gives you a very cool tool at an introductory price that will surprise you. 
The Cells
 The cell can be displayed as text values or icons, or you can display it as both. Maybe you want to display it as a check box - no problem! But it doesn't stop there - you can edit it as a drop down listbox with icons and text or even as a drop down calendar for date fields. You're in the driver's seat with The Janus GridEX 2000 and you can fly through your work in style and with ease. 
The Options
 You can include special formatting for each row - so things like color and font strikethru are both easy to setup and do. Then you can add group sorting to it and take it to the next level. With Outlook style grouping, you get + and - symbols to drill up and down your groups. I know what you're thinking. As soon as I do one thing with The Janus GridEX 2000, my users are just going to keep asking for more and more groups. Well I've got a secret for you. Users can just drag the column header to their grouping area and they've created their own grouping all by themselves - without any involvement on your part! Janus GridEX 2000 is also a data-aware component that hooks directly to databases, by using either DAO or the new ADO. The unbound mode of the control is really amazing - when you use the Unbound Events with a collection or an array of data, the control handles all of the sorting and grouping automatically. 
New Features in GridEX 2000
 In GridEX 2000 you'll find some terrific new features including support for cell, column, and row level formatting, aggregate functions for columns, the ability to save and restore layouts, and WSIWYG print and print preview. But that's not all! Janus has also added support for Word-wrapped cells, preview rows, frozen columns, and automatic column sizing. WOW! 
Power Windows
 The Janus GridEX 2000 has power windows. It has the ability to present each record in cards you view. This is just another way Janus Systems has taken grid controls to a more sophisticated level. The Janus GridEX 2000 is definitely not just another grid. It's totally turbo-charged. You will really be able to fly down the information highway with this one. Order this great new release today!
