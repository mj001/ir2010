	The Capital District Visual Basic Users Group
	(CDVBUG) is a non-profit
	users group whose mission is to foster a
	community of persons committed to learning
	and developing professional applications
	using the Microsoft Visual Basic platform.
	Each meeting focuses on a different aspect of

	leading Visual Basic tool vendors. We are
	located in Albany, New York, and attract an
	audience from neighboring counties and states.
