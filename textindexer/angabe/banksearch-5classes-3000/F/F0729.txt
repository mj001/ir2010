Add this code to a new form and then run the form. It will tell you the drivetype for drive C:. Try changing the drive name to your cdrom drive and running it and it should display a msgbox with the words CDROM in it.
Private Const DRIVE_UNKNOWN = 0
Private Const DRIVE_CDROM = 5
Private Const DRIVE_FIXED = 3
Private Const DRIVE_RAMDISK = 6
Private Const DRIVE_REMOVABLE = 2
Private Const DRIVE_REMOTE = 4
Private Declare Function GetDriveType Lib "kernel32" Alias "GetDriveTypeA" (ByVal nDrive As String) As Long
Private Sub Form_Load()
 MsgBox DriveType("C:\")
End Sub
Function DriveType(strPath As String) As String
 Dim strType As String
 
 Select Case GetDriveType(strPath)
 Case DRIVE_UNKNOWN
 DriveType = "UNKNOWN"
 Case DRIVE_CDROM
 DriveType = "CDROM"
 Case DRIVE_FIXED
 DriveType = "FIXED"
 Case DRIVE_RAMDISK
 DriveType = "RAMDISK"
 Case DRIVE_REMOVABLE
 DriveType = "REMOVABLE"
 Case DRIVE_REMOTE
 DriveType = "REMOTE"
 End Select
End Function
