Simple INI file class
By Sam Huggill
Introduction
INI Files now seem to have been completely removed
by the registry, but sometimes they are a much better option. This can be becuase of
safety for the registry, and allowing the user to more easily view and change settings.
This simple wrapper class wraps up a few simple INI file functions into a reusable, drop
in class for instant INI file use. It supports the following methods/properties:
- CreateINI - Creates a new INI file
- GetFile - Returns the value specified in the arguements passed
- INIFile - Gets/Sets the current INI file path
- MakePath - A private function used to create the ini file
- WriteFile - Writes a value to the INI file
You will probably want to extend its functionality by adding more INI file functions.
Anyway, the class is based around two Win API declares: WritePrivateProfileString and
GetPrivateProfileString. Both require a bit of extra work to make them effective, but
overall they are quite simple to use. A good alternative to the Windows Registry.
To get the class working just use:
Private m_cIni As CIniFile
Private Sub Form_Load()
 Set m_cIni = New CIniFile
End Sub
Add a new class module (CIniFIle) and copy the following
code into it:
Option Explicit
'// Private member that holds a reference to
'// the path of our ini file
Private strInI As String
'// Win API Declares
Private Declare Function WritePrivateProfileString _
 Lib "kernel32" Alias "WritePrivateProfileStringA" _
 (ByVal lpApplicationName As String, _
 ByVal lpKeyName As Any, _
 ByVal lpString As Any, _
 ByVal lpFileName As String) As Long
Private Declare Function GetPrivateProfileString _
 Lib "kernel32" Alias "GetPrivateProfileStringA" _
 (ByVal lpApplicationName As String, _
 ByVal lpKeyName As Any, _
 ByVal lpDefault As String, _
 ByVal lpReturnedString As String, _
 ByVal nSize As Long, _
 ByVal lpFileName As String) As Long
Private Function MakePath(ByVal strDrv As String, _
 ByVal strDir As String) As String
 
 '// Makes an INI file: Guarantees a sub dir
 Do While Right$(strDrv, 1) = "\"
 strDrv = Left$(strDrv, Len(strDrv) - 1)
 Loop
 Do While Left$(strDir, 1) = "\"
 strDir = Mid$(strDir, 2)
 Loop
 '// Return the path
 MakePath = strDrv & "\" & strDir
End Function
Public Sub CreateIni(strDrv As String, strDir As String)
 '// Make a new ini file
 strInI = MakePath(strDrv, strDir)
End Sub
Public Sub WriteFile(strSection As String, _
 strKey As String, _
 strValue As String)
 
 '// Write to strINI
 WritePrivateProfileString strSection, _
 strKey, strValue, strInI
End Sub
Public Function GetFile(strSection As String, _
 strKey As String) As String
 Dim strTmp As String
 Dim lngRet As String
 strTmp = String$(100, 0)
 lngRet = GetPrivateProfileString(strSection, _
 strKey, "", strTmp, _
 Len(strTmp), strInI)
 
 GetFile = strTmp
 
End Function
Public Property Let INIFile(ByVal New_IniPath As String)
 '// Sets the new ini path
 strInI = New_IniPath
 
End Property
Public Property Get INIFile() As String
 '// Returns the current ini path
 INIFile = strInI
 
End Property
