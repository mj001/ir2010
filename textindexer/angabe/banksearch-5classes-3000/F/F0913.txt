	GanttTimePackage 
	 
	If You Need to Visualize Time, This is the Tool to Do It 
	From plexityHide 
	 
	
 
Using the GanttTimePackage, you will be able to meet your future users' expectations of viewing and manipulating time information. As a developer, you can keep your own personal touch of look and feel, and still get complex things done quickly. As a manager, you can trust that your developers have a state-of-the-art time visualization tool. These royalty-free components are truly generic and are frequently used in many branches of industry and service. And when it comes to producing output, the time package doesn't set any limitations - just specify what you want to see and send it to the printer, a bitmap, jpeg or a third party reporting tool.
When is the delivery due? How long has she been employed? Is that office taken next Friday? Who works this weekend? When did that plane arrive? Does this event depend on other things? In which order should this be done? Why is it taking so long? What happens next year? Does it correlate to what happened last year? Hey - you cannot rent that room to two persons at the same time! What is the overlap? Time visualization is needed in almost all administrative projects!
