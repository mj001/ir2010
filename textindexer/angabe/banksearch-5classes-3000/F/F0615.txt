In the code window for the UserControl select the Tools -> Procedure Attributes menu items. When the procedure attributes window appears select the event you want to be the default event in the Name ComboBox. then click the Advanced button.
Under the Attributes frame select the checkbox called "User Interface Default" and then press ok. That event you selected is now the default event for your control.
NOTE: If you cut and paste that event in your code the information you entered in the Procedure Attributes will be lost and you will have to set it again.
