binary files from a .res file
 
To
load any binary resources you put in a .res file, we should do the following:
1.
Save the resource as a "CUSTOM" type resource;
2.
Load it from the file into a byte array;
3.
Save the array in a normal file;
4.
Load the file.
In
this example, we'll cover how to load a JPEG picture. Take a look at the
code:
Code: 
Public
Sub LoadDataIntoFile (DataName As String, Filename As String)
Dim
myArray() As Byte 'Byte array
Dim
myFile As Long 
If
Dir(Filename) = "" Then 
' Check if Filename exists
' If
not, load the resource into the byte array:
myArray
= LoadResData(DataName, "CUSTOM")
myFile
= FreeFile
Open
Filename For Binary Access Write As #myFile 
'Open file
Put
#myFile, , myArray 'Write array to file
Close
#myFile 'Close file 
End
If 
End
Sub
Ok.
Now that you've got the function, use it just like the following:
LoadDataIntoFile
"JPEGRes", "c:\vb5\Pic.jpg" '
This loads the resource named
 
' "JPEGRes" into the file "Pic.jpg"
After
all, do what you want with the file : ) .
