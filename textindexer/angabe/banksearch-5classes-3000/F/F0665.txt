Visual Basic: The User Interface
Control Events
Programming for a GUI (Graphical User Interface) is not as straight forward as programming a normal sequential program i.e. one that starts with the first line of code runs throught every other line of code in sequence and finishes with the last line of code. Programming in a GUI introduces a random element....the USER!. 
The user can go anywhere and do anything
Each custom control is also associated with a set of events. The most obvious is the click event assocaited with a button. Instructions can be associated with different events
