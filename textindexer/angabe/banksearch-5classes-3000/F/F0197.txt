	Q. Any idea why Intellisence won't let me type "Imports System.DirectoryServices" in my VB.NET program? I'm running on WinXP Pro and everything else I do in VS.NET works fine. I tried installing ads.exe from Microsoft (adsi 2.5 setup), but it blows off with:

	Q. I am trying to install Visual Studio.NET in Windows 98 SE, but I am having trouble understanding the installation instructions. Some of the instructions are circular with reference to Win98SE. They package comes with six CDs, CD1 - 4 plus Windows Components and one other. I don't know which one to start with.
Please forgive me for my ignorance on this, what's a Windows Installer?
I don't remember using one, when I installed VB6 or any other programs for
that matter. A lot of the installation references are made about remote
operation. I thought the Professional version supposed to be on a
workstation?
I called Microsoft's reps. but they never return my call as promised.
 
Could you please tell me how to install Visual Studio.NET Professional
in Windows 98 SE?

	Q. I have source code for a Visual Basic version 3 project and would like
to upgrade it to VB.NET. I am unsure of how to proceed and what would be my
best course of action. There are 11 .vbx files, over 20 form files, and
over 15 .bas files that are used in the current project. Also I do not have
VB version 3. What would you suggest would be my best course to upgrade
this project? Answer
	
	 
	
	
	 
	Q. I just purchased a copy of Visual Studio.NET (Academic version). I have
been trying to install it in my Windows XP Professional and I am unable to. When
running the installation program I receive a fatal error. I tried installing
manually, and I am able to install everything but the runtime -- it gives
me the error, again. I have looked for patches, asked questions around and
seem to go nowhere. Any suggestions? Thanks. Answer
