I don't understand your question.
From what I understand of your question the AA.EXE has a command button that when clicked writes out a program BB.EXE.
 
What would the BB.EXE be an executable of? Are you going to be passing some type of source code (VB, C++, etc.) and calling a compilier for the language in question? Most languages have the ability to be compiled from the command prompt instead of from within an IDE. If that is the case I would call a shell command to run the compilier for the language in question. If you're thinking something else I don't know.
