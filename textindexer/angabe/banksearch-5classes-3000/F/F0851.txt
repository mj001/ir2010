Adding a file to the most recent documents list
You may have noticed that when you click the 'Start' button in Windows, you can access a list of the most recently used documents. Well, if your application makes use of any sort of data file, you may want to add a document to that list, too.
You can do this by using the SHAddToRecentDocs API:
Declare Sub SHAddToRecentDocs Lib "shell32.dll" _
(ByVal uFlags As Long, ByVal pv As String) 
 
Now that the function has been declared, the following code can be used to add a file to the list.
Dim NewFile as String
NewFile="c:\newfile.file"
Call SHAddToRecentDocs(2,NewFile) 
 
You can also clear the list of files by using the following code.
Call SHAddToRecentDocs(2,vbNullString)
