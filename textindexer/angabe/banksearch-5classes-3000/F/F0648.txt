Writing To Files
Sooner or later your going to need to save data in Visual Basic. That's where "Writing To Files" comes in. For example you have gathered a list of phone numbers, you can save that data, and then restore it again when your application starts. Read on.
Before writing to a file your going to have to locate it and open it. The 
Open statement does just that.
Opening Files
Open TheFileYouWantToOpen For SelectedOpenMode As TheFileNumber

Append - Meaning that you need to write to the end of the file, if it exists, if not VB makes it
Input - Meaning you need to read from the file
Output - Meaning you need to OverWrite the file if it exists, if it doesn't exist VB makes it, and then writes to it
 Open "C:\My.dat" For Append As #1 'Opening the file My.dat
Closing Files
Once you open, finish using it you should close it! Here's some code:
 Close 1 'Closes the file # 1
Or you might use:
 Close 'Closes all files
Deleting Files

 Kill "C:\my.dat"
 Note: Kill Permanently deletes the file from your HD
