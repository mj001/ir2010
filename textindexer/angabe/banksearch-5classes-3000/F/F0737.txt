 Collections
Collections in VB are pretty much the same type of collections you find in the real world, such as a toy collection, card collection, game collection etc etc... And just as how in real world collections, more likely than not, you have your collection organized in a certain order, you can organize Collections in VB in a certain order aswell. Collections in VB are used for a few things, like storing data as an array does, or organize objects like Classes.
Collections have 4 methods; Add, Count, Item and Remove. You've seen these before, and should have a good understanding of what they do right off the bat, but we'll look at 'em anyway :)
Method - Description
 .Add (Item, Key, Before, After) - Item is the member that will be added, rest are optional
 .Count - Gets the total number of items in the collection
 .Item (Index) - Gets info on the item you want
 .Remove (Index) - Removes the item you want, determined by its index value
As you can see, the 'Add' method has a couple of parameters... 'Key' is basically a unique String that can be used to identify an item, like "JamesBrown," or "MustangGT." The Before and After params are there so you can sort your collection. Lets say you wanted to add a new item to the collection, and you wanted to put it before the 3rd member, the syntax would look like so Coll.Add Item, "It's Cool", 3. Now you should pretty much know how to use the After param.
You can use the Item method to retrieve a certain item, baised on its index value, or key...
Example:
 Coll.Item(1)
Or
 Coll.Item "Its Cool"
The Remove method is pretty simple to use... All you have to do is put the index of the item you want to remove, and it's done...
Example:
Coll.Remove 32
