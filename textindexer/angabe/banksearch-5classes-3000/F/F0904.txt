You will need to add a reference to the Microsoft Scriping Runtime Library, then call this function and pass in the drive letter you wish to check for space on such as this: x = GetFreeSpace("C") 
Private Function GetFreeSpace(ByVal strDriveLetter As String) As Long
 Dim fso As Scripting.FileSystemObject
 Dim dr As Scripting.Drive
 
 Set fso = New Scripting.FileSystemObject
 
 GetFreeSpace = fso.GetDrive(strDriveLetter).FreeSpace
 
 Set fso = Nothing
 
End Function
