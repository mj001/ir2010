In this tutorial you will learn
the basics of the MS Chart Control. It is an .ocx that creates many types
of graphics, including 3d rotational ones, and supports population via
data arrays. 
 
1. Starting
up 
First, click on your toolbar
and select components. Then choose the Microsoft Chart Control
from the list and then click OK. 
You now see the MS Chart icon
on your toolbar. Click it once and position it at your form... 
And it's ready to use!

Ok... So let's take a look on
the properties of this control... 
2.1
- The RowCount and ColumnCount properties 
These two properties set or
return the number of rows and columns in your chart. Examine the following
picture to understand it better: 
 
As you could see, a row contains
a given number of columns. In the example, we have the RowCount and the
ColumnCount properties set to 3: 
MSChart1.RowCount = 3 
MSChart2.ColumnCount = 3

2.2
- Modifying your chart data 
You can modify your chart data
by simply setting the current Row and Column ( Row and Column
properties), and then using the Data property. For example, to set
the value of the second column (the green one) of the third row, you can
use this: 
MSChart1.Row = 3 
MSChart1.Column = 2 
MSChart1.Data = 14 
Simple, huh? The code sets the
current row and column, and then uses the Data property to alter
the graphic. 
Please note that the Row, Column
and Data properties can be used to return values too.

2.3
- Legends 
Well, it's easy to add text
to identify things in your chart. 
To change a row label,
first set the current row and then use the RowLabel property: 
MSChart1.Row = 1 
MSChart1.RowLabel = "First
row" 
To change a column label
(that will appear at the legend), set the current column and use the ColumnLabel
property: 
MSChart1.Column = 3 
MSChart1.ColumnLabel = "Blue" 
You can either add a footnote
and a title to your chart: 
MSChart1.FootnoteText = "You
can add a footnote to your graphic." 
MSChart1.TitleText = "VB Center
MS Chart Tutorial" 
-> You must set the ShowLegend
property to True, in order to show you legend.

2.4
- Changing fonts and text locations 
To alter fonts, use the Footnote
and Title objects contained at your MS Chart control. The purpose
of this tutorial is to teach you the basics of chart creation, so if you
want to learn more about this, try reading the VB help. This section will
only list some possible combinations you may use. 
For example: 
MSChart1.Footnote.Font.Bold
= True 
MSChart1.Title.Font.Name
= "Trebuchet MS" 
MSChart1.Footnote.Location.Rect.Set 
200,100 
Footnote
and Title objects: 
Backdrop
object 
FONT
object 
Location
object 
Text
- String 
TextLayout 
TextLength
- Integer 
 
Font object 
 
 
Bold - Boolean 
 
Italic - Boolean 
 
Name - String 
 
Size - Integer 
 
StrikeThrough - Boolean 
 
Underline - Boolean 
 
Weight - Integer

2.5
- Populating your chart with a two-dimensional array: 
You can create a two-dimensional
array ( a table ) and then use it to populate your graphic. The following
code fills an array and uses it to draw your chart with random numbers: 
Dim
Data(1 To 10, 1 To
10) As String 
Private
Sub Form_Load() 
For
i = 1 To 10 'Create
loop to fill array 
 For
o = 1 To 10 
 
 Data(i,
o) = Rnd * 100 'Assign
a random value between 0 and 100 
 
 Next
o 
 
Next
i 
MSChart1.ChartData = Data 
End Sub 
The ChartData property
is used to fill you graphic. When you assign an array to this property,
the RowCount and ColumnCount properties are automatically set to hold it.

2.6
- Changing the type of your graphic 
The MS Chart control lets you
alter it's appearance by changing the ChartType property. 
The ChartType constants are: 
 
VtChChartType3dBar 
3D Bar 
VtChChartType2dBar 
2D Bar 
VtChChartType3dLine 
3D Line 
VtChChartType2dLine 
2D Line 
VtChChartType3dArea 
3D Area 
VtChChartType2dArea 
2D Area 
VtChChartType3dStep 
3D Step 
VtChChartType2dStep 
2D Step 
VtChChartType3dCombination 
3D Combination 
VtChChartType2dCombination 
2D Combination 
VtChChartType2dPie 
2D Pie 
VtChChartType2dXY 
2D XY 
e.g. : MSChart1.ChartType = VtChChartType2dLine
'Changes the graph to a 2D line

- Other 
There are many more things you
can do with this control. For example, use MSChart1.Stacking to stack your
series, or change borders, fonts and text orientation with the footnote
and title objects inside MS Chart. Use the custom dialog to edit
your chart at design time. Did you know that you can copy your graphic
to the clipboard with MSChart1.EditCopy ? Well, it's now your part to discover
other functions! And if you find something interessant, please share
your code snippet with other programmers! All the credits will be given.
