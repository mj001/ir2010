	 Developer Fusion
This site is an excellent 
	 resource for VB and VB.NET material, with great code snippets, tutorials 
	 and more. But what stands out about this site is the quality of work 
	 that goes into each example. Too many sites have the same old code, but 
	 Developer Fusion has all original content which makes simply reading 
	 code a joy again. 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 Game Development Search Engine
Working on a game? This 
	 site has a ton of information, and provides an amazing search engine to 
	 find relevant information on game programming concepts such as bounding 
	 boxes, sprites, collision detection, and much more.
	 
But you need C++ to make a game right? Wrong! You can use Visual 
	 Basic 6 if you like they have a bunch of sample code and tutorials to 
	 get up to speed and working the technologies such as DirectX, right from 
	 Visual Basic. And now with .NET a reality you can supercharge your 
	 VB.NET code with these same tutorials and tips, in a true OOP, 
	 multithreaded language!
