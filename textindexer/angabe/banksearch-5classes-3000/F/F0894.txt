Making a Form stay on Top
 
Moving a Form Without a Title Bar
Sometimes, you may want remove the title bar of a form. But, when you do this,
you're unable to move it. So, to fix this problem, use this code. It will
move the form when you click and drag it.
'This code in the declarations section of your form:
Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "User32" _
Alias "SendMessageA" (ByVal hWnd As Long, _
ByVal wMsg As Long, _
ByVal wParam As Long, _
lParam As Any) As Long
Private Declare Sub ReleaseCapture Lib "User32" ()
Const WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN = &HA1
Const HTCAPTION = 2
'And this at the form's MouseMove event:
Private Sub Form_MouseMove(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single)
Dim lngReturnValue As Long
If Button = 1 Then
Call ReleaseCapture
lngReturnValue = SendMessage(Form1.hWnd, WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN, _
HTCAPTION, 0&)
End If
End Sub
Done! Now run the project, drag the form and see what happens!
