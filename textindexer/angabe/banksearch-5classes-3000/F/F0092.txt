FTP Access through a Class Module for VB5/6 - Requires WinInet.DLL
Author: Chris Eastwood
Author's WebSite: http://www.eastwood60.freeserve.co.uk
FTP Access through a Class Module - Requires WinInet.DLL 
 
The attached project contains a re-usable class module that encapsulates the FTP API commands available through the WinInet.DLL. 
 
It should be pointed out that this class module uses a Disconnected Recordset and therefore requires a reference to Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Recordset Library 2.1 Library. You could remove this dependancy by simply returning a collection of Objects for each file found in the FTP directory. 
All of the FTP work is carried out in the class module supplied with the project. The cFTP class can be dropped into any project that needs FTP access, and exposes the properties : 
- Host 
- User 
- Password 
- Directory 
- Connected - (returns True/False depending on connection state) 
The following methods are also provided : 
public Function Connect(optional Host as string, _
 optional User as string, _
 optional Password as string) as Boolean
 
- This function connects to the required FTP server using the User and Password parameters (if supplied - otherwise, the standard properties are used). 
public Function GetFile(byval ServerFileAndPath as string, _
	byval DestinationFileAndPath as string, _
	optional TransferType as FileTransferType = ftAscii) as Boolean
 
- Downloads a file from the FTP server 
public Function PutFile(byval LocalFileAndPath as string, _
	byval ServerFileAndPath as string, _
	optional TransferType as FileTransferType) as Boolean
 
- Uploads a file to the FTP server 
public Function RenameFile(byval ExistingName as string, _
	byval NewName as string) as Boolean
 
- renames a file on the FTP server 
public Function DeleteFile(byval ExistingName as string) as Boolean
 
- delete's a file from the FTP server 
public Function GetDirectoryList(optional Directory as string, _
	optional FilterString as string) as ADOR.Recordset
 
- this routine returns a disconnected RecordSet containing the current
directory listing from the FTP server. You could easily change the code 
in this routine to identify Directories, different file types etc. I've 
left the recordset containing just the Name of the file entry so that 
it can be modified as required. 
If you don't have ADO 2 installed on your machine, you can remove the 
reference and simply return a collection of filenames / objects / 
whatever from this routine. 
public Function Disconnect() as Boolean
 
- Disconnects from the FTP server 
 
A sample of using the code in another project could be : 
Dim oFTP as cFTP
'
set oFTP = new cFTP
oFTP.Connect "ftp.somewhere.com", "anonymous", "chris@here.now"
oFTP.Directory = "downloads"
oFTP.GetFile "test.zip", "c:\downloads\test.zip"
oFTP.Disconnect
set oFTP = nothing
That's really all there is to it - Enjoy the code !
