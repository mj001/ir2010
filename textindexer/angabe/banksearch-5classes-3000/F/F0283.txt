 VB TreeView and ListView
 Explorer demo
 
 Well, I guess this demo has been due out for a while... It's basically the EnumDeskVB demo stripped of much of its complicated (and
 excessive) code that is not only required to create and operate the real treeview and
 listview common controls, but also the code used for the complicated IShellFolder
 reference handling as well. The demo is honed into the tightest and most compact possible
 and emulates almost complete Explorer treeview and listview window functionality, but
 using VB controls. Though it does less than EnumDeskVB, and with less than one half of the
 code, it actually does a lot more, and does it better...
 
 As with EnumDeskVB, this demo utilizes both the IShellFolder interface, and the
 IShellFolder's child interface, the IEnumIDList interface, while processing the
 notification messages sent by the TreeView and ListView controls; it also enumerates the
 shell's namespace and displays the names and icons of any and all file system objects in
 each control. Other interesting Explorer-like behavior is thrown in, including right-click
 shell context menu functionality with help from the IContextMenu interface, and for good
 measure, a deceivingly simple little splitter bar is used to simultaneously adjust the
 size of both control windows within their parent Form. Other various (and subtle) Explorer
 view functionality is also demonstrated.
 
 But unlike EnumDeskVB, this demo does a few other things as well. First, notification
 messages sent by the TreeView and ListView controls are received directly within the
 controls' subclassing window procedures via the OCM_NOTIFY message, eliminating the need
 to subclass the controls' parent window, typically a Form. The system imagelist is
 assigned directly to both the TreeView and ListView controls, as is demonstrated in both
 the VB Directory TreeView and System
 Imagelist demos, respectively. Directional sort icons are also displayed in ListView
 column headers as is demonstrated by the ListView Header Sort Icons
 demo.
 
 But where things really begin to get interesting is the demo's use of the IShellDetails
 interface, which provides ListView column information for the contents of most shell
 folders, without the need to explicitly extract the details with the FindFirst/NextFile
 APIs. Also, item details are sorted in the respective ListView columns by passing the
 column's index value to the IShellFolder CompareIDs member function, functionality that
 was just recently discovered in this part of the universe.
 
 As always, the source code is fairly adequately documented, and has been tested and run
 successfully without incident using controls from both Comctl32.ocx and Mscomctl.ocx in
 VB5 and VB6 on Win95/IE3, Win98, WinNT4 SP3 and SP5, and Win2K rc2. Note that the
 Mscomctl.ocx ListView exhibits unusual behavior when ListItems are selected in large icon
 view. This may be due to directly setting ListItem icon indices with the listview's
 LVM_SETITEM message, but the exact cause has yet to be determined...
