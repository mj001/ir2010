 Win32Errors: How to obtain
 descriptions of a Win32 error codes
 
 If a description of a Visual Basic run-time error can be obtained with the Err object's
 Description property (or with the Error function), why couldn't a description of a Win32
 API error be obtained? Well it can, of course...
 
 Win32err.zip contains sample code implementing the FormatMessage() API call which returns
 a description of every error code defined by Win32 in Win95 or WinNT (OLE error codes
 too). We're talking over 1000 of them. It's a pretty cool code. So cool you'll find it in
 Issue #2 of the 1997 VB Tips & Tricks help file.
