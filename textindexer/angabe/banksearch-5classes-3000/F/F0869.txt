	What VB Is
	Visual Basic is one of the most powerful and easiest Windows programming languages available today. The newest version is VB6. VB is just an application itself that you use to create almost anything imaginable, so lets get started...
	VB comes in three editions, the Learning Edition (LE), the Professional Edition (Pro), and the Enterprise Edition (Ent). The Learning Edition is the cheapest of the three, retails for about $100, and comes w/ a complete development environment, but it's missing some tools that the other two editions have.
	The Professional Edition goes for about $500, but it offers more tools that the Learning Edition doesn't include, such as a Help file compiler, and much better Internet programming support. Mostly out of the three types of VB editions, programmers use the Professional Edition. If you don't have VB and are thinking about buying it, your much better off buying the Professional Edition (and off eBay might I add, they're much cheaper!) and not even bothering upgrading it later...
	As for the Enterprise Edition, it's mostly used by Server/Client programmers for networking purposes with more tools of that nature. Not to mention it's costly, going for $1,000+...
