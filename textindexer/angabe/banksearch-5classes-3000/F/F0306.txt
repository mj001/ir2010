Printing
Text
 
This article explains how to
print text to any DC using the Win32 API:
 
1 - Create a new project
in Visual Basic and add a module to it;
2 - Place the following
code in the module:
Declare
Function MoveToEx
Lib "gdi32" Alias
"MoveToEx" (ByVal hdc
As Long,
ByVal x As Long,
ByVal y As Long,
_
lpPoint
As POINTAPI)
As Long
Declare
Function TextOut Lib
"gdi32" Alias
"TextOutA" (ByVal
hdc As Long,
ByVal x As
Long, ByVal
y As Long, _
ByVal
lpString As String,
ByVal nCount
As Long)
As Long
Type POINTAPI
 
x As Long
 
y As Long
End Type
'---------------------------------------------
Public
Sub PrintText(DestDC
As Long, X As
Long, Y As Long,
ByVal Text As
String)
Dim
txtPointAPI As
POINTAPI
Call MoveToEx(DestDC,
X, Y, txtPointAPI)
Call
TextOut(DestDC, X, Y, Text, Len(Text))
End Sub
3- After this, use the
function whenever you want, like in the example here:
Private
Sub Form_Paint()
PrintText
Form1.hdc, 10, 10, "Testing..."
End Sub
If you want to change the font
or the color you're printing, just change the destination's properties
Font and ForeColor. You can even acheive 3D effects using
loops and printing text, and the function is much faster than using object.Print!!!
The sample code shows how
to create a cool 3D effect to your text
