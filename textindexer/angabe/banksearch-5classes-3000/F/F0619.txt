Placing a progress bar in a status bar panel
Tip by Sam Huggill
 
Tip description 
 
 
 
Tip Code 
 
This tip was written by Chris Eastwood (www.codeguru.com/vb/) To use this tip add a form with a progress bar, a status bar and a command button on. Copy the following code into the form's General Declarations procedure:
'Declarations
'
' API Declarations
'
Private Declare Function SetParent Lib "user32" (ByVal hWndChild As _
Long, ByVal hWndNewParent As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function SendMessageAny Lib "user32" Alias "SendMessageA" _
(ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal msg As Long, ByVal wParam As Long, lParam _
As Any) As Long
'
' API Types
'
' RECT is used to get the size of the panel we're inserting into
'
Private Type RECT
 Left As Long
 Top As Long
 Right As Long
 Bottom As Long
End Type
'
' API Messages
'
Private Const WM_USER As Long = &H400
Private Const SB_GETRECT As Long = (WM_USER + 10)
Private Sub ShowProgressInStatusBar(ByVal bShowProgressBar As Boolean) 
 Dim tRC As RECT
 If bShowProgressBar Then
 '
 ' Get the size of the Panel (2) Rectangle from the status bar
 ' remember that Indexes in the API are always 0 based (well,
 ' nearly always) - therefore Panel(2) = Panel(1) to the api
 '
 '
 SendMessageAny StatusBar1.hwnd, SB_GETRECT, 1, tRC
 '
 ' and convert it to twips....
 '
 With tRC
 .Top = (.Top * Screen.TwipsPerPixelY)
 .Left = (.Left * Screen.TwipsPerPixelX)
 .Bottom = (.Bottom * Screen.TwipsPerPixelY) - .Top
 .Right = (.Right * Screen.TwipsPerPixelX) - .Left
 End With
 '
 ' Now Reparent the ProgressBar to the statusbar
 '
 With ProgressBar1
 SetParent .hwnd, StatusBar1.hwnd
 .Move tRC.Left, tRC.Top, tRC.Right, tRC.Bottom
 .Visible = True
 .Value = 0
 End With
 Else
 '
 ' Reparent the progress bar back to the form and hide it
 '
 SetParent ProgressBar1.hwnd, Me.hwnd
 ProgressBar1.Visible = False
 End If
End Sub
Private Sub Command1_Click()
 'Call the function
 Call ShowProgressInStatusBar(True)
 
 'Do something in the progress bar
 For i = 1 To ProgressBar1.Max
 ProgressBar1.Value = i
 Next i
End Sub
