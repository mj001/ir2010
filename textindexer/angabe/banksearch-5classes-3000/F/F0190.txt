Tutorial: How to make a gradient
between two colors
This tutorial shows how to
create a gradient between two colors. Follow this example and
you'll finish up with a program like the one here available for download.
Well, first of all, you
should let the user choose two distinct colors before trying to
draw a gradient. Create a new form and place some scroll bars so
we can adjust the red, green and blue values for both colors.
Also, place two pictureboxes to show the current color. Here we
have a list of controls to create and a screenshot:
 
 
 
 Control Name 
 Control Type 
 Max
 Property 
 Purpose 
 
 
 RVal1 
 Horizontal
 Scrollbar 
 255 
 Red value
 for the first color 
 
 
 GVal1 
 Horizontal
 Scrollbar 
 255 
 Green
 value for the first color 
 
 
 BVal1 
 Horizontal
 Scrollbar 
 255 
 Blue value
 for the first color 
 
 
 RVal2 
 Horizontal
 Scrollbar 
 255 
 Red value
 for the second color 
 
 
 GVal2 
 Horizontal
 Scrollbar 
 255 
 Green
 value for the second color 
 
 
 BVal2 
 Horizontal
 Scrollbar 
 255 
 Blue value
 for the second color 
 
 
 picColor1 
 PictureBox 
 Unused 
 Display
 the 1st color 
 
 
 picColor2 
 PictureBox 
 Unused 
 Display
 the 2nd color 
 
 
 
 
Order:
 
 
 RVal1 
 RVal2 
 
 
 GVal1 
 GVal2 
 
 
 BVal1 
 BVal2 
 
 
 picColor1 
 picColor2 
 
 
 
 
After we've done this, we
have to write some code to change the pictureboxes colors when we
alter the value of some scrollbar. Next we'll create two
functions: each one will adjust the colors for both pictures. You
can place the code inside your form's declarations section.
 Sub
 AdjustPic1()
 'First color
 picColor1.BackColor =
 RGB(RVal1.Value, GVal1.Value, BVal1.Value)
 End Sub
 
 Sub
 AdjustPic2()
 'Second color
 picColor2.BackColor =
 RGB(RVal2.Value, GVal2.Value, BVal2.Value)
 End Sub
 
 Private Sub
 RVal1_Change()
 AdjustPic1
 End Sub
 
 Private Sub
 GVal1_Change()
 AdjustPic1
 End Sub
 
 Private Sub
 BVal1_Change()
 AdjustPic1
 End Sub
 
 Private Sub
 RVal2_Change()
 AdjustPic2
 End Sub
 
 Private Sub
 GVal2_Change()
 AdjustPic2
 End Sub
 
 Private Sub
 BVal2_Change()
 AdjustPic2
 End Sub
As you must have noticed,
the Change event is fired whenever you change the value
of a scrollbar. Now run the project (press F5) and play with the
scroll bars. Notice that the colors in the pictureboxes change
accordingly to your RGB settings!
Yeah right. The first step
is done. Now for the second part. Create another picture that
will contain the gradient itself, and a command button to draw
the gradient. Name them picGradient and cmdDraw,
respectively.
Set picGradient's ScaleMode
propery to 3 - pixels, and cmdDraw's Caption propery to
"Draw gradient". You'll have something like this:
 
 
 Now
 we've reached the math part. I won't explain the gradient
 formula so much, just follow the code. Declare some
 variables in the declarations section of your form: 
 
 Dim
 curR As Double 'Current red value
 Dim
 curG As Double 'Green value
 Dim
 curB As Double 'Blue
 
 Dim
 Rinc As Double 'Red increment per
 loop
 Dim
 Ginc As Double 'Green increment
 Dim
 Binc As Double 'Blue increment
And here's the sub that
will draw the gradient on the picturebox:
 Sub
 DrawGradient()
 
 curR = RVal1.Value
 curG = GVal1.Value
 curB = BVal1.Value
 
 Rinc = (RVal2.Value -
 RVal1.Value) / picGradient.ScaleWidth
 Ginc = (GVal2.Value -
 GVal1.Value) / picGradient.ScaleWidth
 Binc = (BVal2.Value -
 BVal1.Value) / picGradient.ScaleWidth
 
 For
 curx = 0 To picGradient.ScaleWidth 'Loop
 that draws the gradient
 
 picGradient.Line
 (curx, 0)-(curx, picGradient.ScaleHeight), _
 RGB(curR,
 curG, curB)
 
 curR = curR + Rinc
 curG = curG + Ginc
 curB = curB + Binc
 
 Next
 curx
 End Sub
To end things up, place the
command to draw the gradient when the user clicks cmdDraw:
 Private Sub
 cmdDraw_Click()
 DrawGradient
 End Sub
And that's it! If you
followed our steps correctly, you should end up with something
like this:
