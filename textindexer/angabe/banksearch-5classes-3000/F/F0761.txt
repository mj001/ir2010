Raising the Bar
With their recent releases of Office 2000 and Windows 2000, Microsoft once again has upped the feature ante in user interface design. In order for Visual Basic developers to support these new features in their applications, Data Dynamics has delivered in their latest (and greatest) version of ActiveBar 2.x, once again setting the standard in total Toolbar design and implementation. 
Any Tool - Bar None!
ActiveBar 2.x supports just about any type of Toolbar you can think of. New UI features you see in Office and Windows 2000 are available, including personalized menus (the ones in the Office apps that are hidden until you need them) and menu flyouts for complete Toolbar user custom-ization and configuration. ActiveBar toolbars consist of individual "Bands" that contain groups of "Tools." Tools can be just about any type of control: Static and Dropdown Buttons, TextBox, ComboBox, Label, Separator, and even other ActiveX controls. ActiveBar "Bands" can be - check this - Toolbars, Menus, Status Bars (with multiple varieties of panels), and Context Popup Menus. Need a Microsoft Outlook sidebar? No problem with ActiveBar 2.0. Need detachable Context Popup Menus? Dockable Forms? Toolbars with tabbed bands and shortcut bars? You can create all of these styles with ActiveBar 2.0! Plus, ActiveBar toolbars are fully dockable, which means you can provide support for positioning them on the top, bottom, right, and left edges of the control window. Or, if you like your Toolbars detached, you can implement the "floating" variety as well. What more could you ask for? 
If I Were Michelangelo...
Well, you don't have to be to create your "Tool" icons using the ActiveBar 2.0 Designer. The WYSIWYG designer operates directly on Forms, making Toolbar creation as easy as visual drag and drop. ActiveBar includes a library of standard toolbar icons, but if you do happen to feel like Michelangelo, a full-featured Icon Editor is included. The Icon Editor can even provide you with a design jump-start by enabling the capture of standard system menus from other running applications. The Designer enables you to create Band and Tool "categories" and "layouts," which can then be saved to the Designer library and reused in your other VB applications. Talk about a time-saver!
