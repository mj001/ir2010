 Steven Abbott 
 
 
 
 
 One of Steve's interests is Celtic knots. Steve modified some of the programs in Visual Basic Graphics 
 Programming to display some remarkable Celtic knots in three-dimensions.
 
 
 
 
 
- Three interlaced knots head-on
- Three interlaced knots at an angle
- Eight knots intertwined
Steve's programs can generate images, POVRay output, and VRML 1 output. Download his popular
free
knot programs including a screen saver and find links to other Celtic knot sites at
Steve's Web page.
 
 
 Jon Hawkes 
 
 
 
 
 Jon has taken the output produced by Steve's Celtic knot programs and
 used them in other graphics packages to produce some spectacular images.
 You must see these!
 
 
- Seven metallic knots
 
- Old and new art

 John Stalcup 
 
 
 
 
 John used techniques similar to those used to draw fractals in
 Visual Basic Graphics Programming
 to create images based on arbitrary equations.
 Read John's description of his technique.
