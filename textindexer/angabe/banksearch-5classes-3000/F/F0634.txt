 Context: Demonstrates extended
 Edit context menu functionality for the RichEdit control
 
 This example demonstrates implementing the main menu's Edit submenu as a right-click
 context menu for the RichEdit control. The RichEdit control executes all keyboard edit
 commands (Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete and Select All), but does not provide it's own
 corresponding edit context menu. As a result, shortcut keys (and their associated command
 strings) cannot be defined for these commands in Visual Basic. 
 
 The example shows how to dynamically add and remove the strings from edit menu when
 displayed in the main menu and as the context menu respectively, as well as how to execute
 all edit menu commands through the Win32API.
 
 Menu placement as a result of keyboard context menu display (via the Shift-F10 key
 combination) and extended word selection are also demonstrated.
