Making
a Transparent Form Effect
 
 
 
This tutorial shows the sample
code on how to create a transparent form effect. Please note that the form
must have no borders and also be positioned mannualy. You'll get something
like the screenshot at the end of this page. 
 
Let's start placing this code
in a .bas module:
Option Explicit
Declare Function
BitBlt Lib "gdi32"
Alias "BitBlt"
(ByVal hDestDC
As Long,
ByVal x As Long,
ByVal y As Long,_
ByVal nWidth As
Long, ByVal
nHeight As Long,
ByVal hSrcDC
As Long, ByVal
xSrc As Long,
ByVal ySrc As
Long,_ ByVal
dwRop As Long)
As Long
Declare Function
GetDesktopWindow Lib
"user32" Alias
"GetDesktopWindow" () As Long
Declare Function
GetWindowDC Lib
"user32" Alias
"GetWindowDC" (ByVal
hwnd As Long) As Long
Declare Function
ReleaseDC Lib
"user32" Alias
"ReleaseDC" (ByVal
hwnd As Long,
ByVal hdc As
Long) As Long
Public Const SRCCOPY
= &HCC0020 
' Raster Operation
Public DesktopHDC
As Long 
' This variable will store the Desktop handle
Public Desktop As
Long 
' This will store the Desktop device context
'--------------------------------
 
Public Sub drawDesktop(Dest
As Form)
 Dest.AutoRedraw
= True
Desktop = GetDesktopWindow()
DesktopHDC = GetWindowDC(Desktop)
Call BitBlt(Dest.hdc,
0, 0, Dest.Width / Screen.TwipsPerPixelX, _
Dest.Height / Screen.TwipsPerPixelY, DesktopHDC,
Dest.Left / Screen.TwipsPerPixelX, _
Dest.Top / Screen.TwipsPerPixelY, SRCCOPY)
Call ReleaseDC(Desktop,
DesktopHDC) 'Free
used resource
End Sub
After copying this code, add
the following to the Form_Initialize event:
'Sample
code for Form1
Private
Sub Form_Initialize()
Call
PaintDesk(Form1)
End Sub
As simple
as that!
