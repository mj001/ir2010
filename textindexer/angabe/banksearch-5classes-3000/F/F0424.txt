 Win32ErrorApp: Retrieves
 descriptions of any or all Win32 API and OLE error codes
 
 After posting the Win32err example on this site, I decided to write a programming utility
 that extends a certain amount of functionality in returning Win32 error code descriptions.
 The application, Win32 Error Codes, will retrieve descriptions of every API and OLE error
 code defined in the Win32 system it's running on.
 
 Win32 Error Codes is a simple yet useful utility written to assist programmers in
 obtaining information about Win32 API and OLE errors during application development. It
 will retrieve a list of all error code descriptions, a list of any given range of error
 code descriptions, or retrieve a single description from any given error code. It also
 displays all of the constants and their respective values defined in Winerror.h (VC5).
 
 Output includes decimal and hexadecimal error code values. Hexadecimal notation can be
 selected as either the C or VB prefix format. Error code descriptions are displayed in a
 RichEdit control window which provides standard text editor functionality. An enhanced
 Find feature is also employed providing the ability to search for any given string in the
 output.
 
 Win32 Error Codes was developed using VB4-32 running on Win95 and has been tested on both
 Win95 and WinNT Server v4.0. You'll need the VB4-32 runtime files & Richtx32.ocx to
 make it work.
 
 If you want to see how it works, you'll find it's core source at on the Win32Errors page.
