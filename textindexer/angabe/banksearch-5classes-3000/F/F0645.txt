DirectShow
- Video streaming using DirectShow
DirectShow is probably a good compromise between flexibility (support for multiple formats) and performance to stream media content to DirectDraw surfaces. Unfortunalety the Quartz.dll file brings to Visual Basic only a subset of the DirectShow capabilities, probably because some of these capabilites were totally useless without a DirectX support. While waiting for DirectX Media to follow the path of DirectX Fundation, with an upcoming support for Visual Basic included in DirectX 7, I tweaked the IDL files provided with the DirectX Media SDK, to be able to use DirectShow streaming capabilities against my own DirectX support...

Notice that the Visual Basic code might be seen as "simpler" than its C++ counterpart. The two main reasons are :
- I don't use explicitely a supplemental IMultiMediaStream object (pMMStream in the C++ code). As IAMMultiMediaStream inherits of IMultiMediaStream, all the capabilities of this later interface are accessible through IAMMultiMediaStream.
- Similarly pPrimaryVidStream (IMediaStream) is not needed when getting the DirectDrawMedia stream as "QueryInterface" is done automatically for you by Visual Basic...
