Image is Everything
 You would think that the owners of JPG.COM would have something grand up their sleeve. With version 6 of ImagXpress, you'd be right! It's no wonder that ImagXpress is regarded as one of the industry's top image display and manipulation controls. My development team and I have used their state-of-the-art control for over a year now - we become more pleased with it every day, and we're now ecstatic about the new version. 
 Gone are the days of counting pixels, measuring twips, and manually resizing images. Just set the 'picture' or 'filename' property in ImagXpress and have a clean looking, properly resized image living right on your VB form or report. It even works great with ActiveReports and via the Internet. 
Above and Beyond the Call of Functionality
 ImagXpress has an extensive list of methods and properties. You can do everything from image type conversion to complex color manipulation. To date, we haven't had to find a single 'work around' for the functions ImagXpress is supposed to perform. And fast ... gosh it is fast! Whether you're displaying a huge TIFF file or a highly compressed JPEG, the images fly to the screen. ImagXpress does this with over 30 image types. You can specify as much or as little information about images you want to display or save. Just drop the image where you want it and you're ready to go. 
 In addition to all of the functionality you would expect with an image control, ImagXpress takes you two steps beyond. We just used it for creating an in-house documentation tool. It takes a snapshot of the screen, saves it to memory, displays it, writes text and graphics into the image, and then saves the finished image. This application alone would have taken exponentially longer to develop without ImagXpress. 
Adaptable to Anything
 For a couple of years, we searched hard for a control that would meet our needs and the needs of our clients. After trying a bunch and even shipping a wrong one, we finally discovered the power of ImagXpress. If you are looking for a replacement for the Visual Basic picture control, or for a replacement for any other picture control that's not currently meeting your needs, my team highly recommends ImagXpress. Oh yeah, it happens to work with VC++, C++ Builder, Delphi, Access, and HTML, so we're happy! Order ImagXpress today, and you will be, too!
