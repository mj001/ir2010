	Chart FX Internet 
	 
	Charting Solution for Programmers and Internet Developers 
	From Software FX 
	 
	
 
Chart FX Internet is a set of server-side and client side components for adding dynamic charting capabilities to Web sites and corporate intranets. On the server side, it includes ActiveX DLLs for Active Server Page development (all we care about :-) but it also includes ISAPI and NSAPI components as well as Standard and Console CGI applications. On the client, although it provides a 32-bit ActiveX for IE3 & IE4 and both 16&32-bit Netscape plugs-ins, it can generate JPG files for least-common denominator approach. This is an incredibly powerful, polished, and well thought-out product that has won many awards in the past. If you need charting, or even think you do, you should check out Chart/FX Internet.

	Item Comparison
	
	
	
- Chart FX Internet - Single Production Server License
This license must be purchased whenever the customer exposes a server to internal or external users. Users are defined as any individual or process who access charts for purposes other than develop code. If the server is to be used for both, development and production, then this is the license to purchase. Please note this license includes 1 CPU for the server and 1 copy of the Chart FX Internet Designer Components. If additional CPUs are installed in the target machine then the customer requires as many Additional CPU Licenses as CPUs are in the target machine.
- Chart FX Internet - Additional CPU License
This license is required whenever a production server has more than 1 CPU. Please note this license is required only with Production Servers and when the server has more than 1 CPU. For example, if the production server has 4 CPUs then the customer is required to purchase 3 additional CPU Licenses.
- Chart FX Internet - Test/Development Server License (Development and Test version only)
This license can be used only when the customer is using the product for development purposes only. This license does not require additional CPU licenses if the development server has more than 1 CPU. Software FX created this licensing scheme to promote the use of its product among consultants and developers who are not going to use the product for their own use, but to create solutions for other companies. When the solution is ready to be deployed then it must be accompanied by its production license(s). Normally, organizations purchase both the production and the test development server because these are usually different machines and therefore each one must be properly licensed by the customer.
- Chart FX Internet- Additional Developer License for Designer Components
The Chart FX Internet provides Designer components that are used by developers in order to speed up the development process. These components are the Chart FX DTC (Design Time Control) which is normally used in the Microsoft Visual Interdev Environment and the Chart FX Internet Template and Code Generator which is a standalone application that is used to generate code by manipulating a chart object. With both, the Production and Test/Development Server Licenses, there's one copy of these components. The user must add additional licenses for developers that are not covered within the server licenses he/she purchased. 
For example, if the customer bought a Test/Development Server License and a Production Server License, and he has 4 developers working with the Chart FX Designer Components, he must add 2 additional designer component licenses.
