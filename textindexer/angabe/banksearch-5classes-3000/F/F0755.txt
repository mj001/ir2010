way to display about 100 records from a recordset into a form

Hi all!
I am looking for a way to display about 100 records from a recordset into a form. I know there are various grids like msflexgrid, mshflexgrid etc to display them, but I think they are not very flexible. Also I want to be able to select one of those records and then modify them if required. Is control array a good idea????
Please suggest a better way. 
Shruti

Hi Shruti,
Control array is not good way to display all 100 records, because it will occupied memory more that grid control. I think you should used datagrid that's very effictive for editing as well as delete or insert records.

I think DataGrid control is one of the best way you can try. You can download the source code at http://www30.brinkster.com/masinosinaga/ go to "Download" folder, click the files that have "database" or "datagrid" keyword in "Deskripsi" column, for example "Database.zip", "Database2.zip", "ADOCode.zip", "DataGrid3.zip", etc... Hope they're useful. 
Best regards,
