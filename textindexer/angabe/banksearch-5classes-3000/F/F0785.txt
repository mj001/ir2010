Sub
 
To force a function wait
a given number of seconds (in a timed loop, for example), without freezing
the program, use the function WaitSecs: 
Sub
WaitSecs (secs As Single) 
 
Dim StartTime as Single 
 
StartTime = Timer 
'initialize timer 
 
 
Do 
 
DoEvents 
'execute pending commands
 
 
Loop Until Timer > StartTime + secs 
End
Sub
