Tutorial:
Associating a File Extension with your Application
Well ok. Let's suppose that
you've created an application that saves lists of names in data files with
an .lst extension. But when you try to open an .lst file, Windows shows
the "Open With" dialog box. Don't you hate it? It would be much nicer if
when you double-clicked the file, it was open directly with your application.
Of course, the program must support command line arguments to know you
want to open the file. But that's content for another tutorial.
In this example we'll create
a function to associate a file type with its program. Insert the code below
in a VB module:
 
Declare
Function RegCreateKey Lib "advapi32.dll" Alias "RegCreateKeyA" _
(ByVal
hKey As Long, ByVal lpSubKey As String, phkResult As Long) As Long
Declare
Function RegSetValue Lib "advapi32.dll" Alias "RegSetValueA" _
(ByVal
hKey As Long, ByVal lpSubKey As String, ByVal dwType As Long, _
ByVal
lpData As String, ByVal cbData As Long) As Long
' Return
codes from Registration functions.
Private
Const ERROR_SUCCESS = 0&
Private
Const ERROR_BADDB = 1&
Private
Const ERROR_BADKEY = 2&
Private
Const ERROR_CANTOPEN = 3&
Private
Const ERROR_CANTREAD = 4&
Private
Const ERROR_CANTWRITE = 5&
Private
Const ERROR_OUTOFMEMORY = 6&
Private
Const ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER = 7&
Private
Const ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED = 8&
Private
Const HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT = &H80000000
Private
Const MAX_PATH = 260&
Private
Const REG_SZ = 1
Public
Sub AssociateFile ( flExtension As String, appName As String, appPath As
String, appDesc As String)
' This
sub creates and sets the necessary keys in the registry
' Arguments:
'
flExtension = the file extension to be associated.
'
appName = your application's name
'
appPath = the path for the app's executable
'
appDesc = a simple description of your program
 
Dim sKeyName As String 'Holds Key Name in registry.
 
Dim sKeyValue As String 'Holds Key Value in registry.
 
Dim ret& 
'Holds error status if any from API calls.
 
Dim lphKey& 'Holds created
key handle from RegCreateKey.
 
'This creates a Root entry for the app's name.
 
sKeyName = appName
 
sKeyValue = appDesc ' The application's description
 
ret& = RegCreateKey (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, sKeyName, lphKey&)
 
ret& = RegSetValue (lphKey&, "", REG_SZ, sKeyValue, 0&)
 
'This creates a Root entry with the name of flExtension associated with
appName
 
sKeyName = flExtension
 
sKeyValue = appName
 
ret& = RegCreateKey (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, sKeyName, lphKey&)
 
ret& = RegSetValue (lphKey&, "", REG_SZ, sKeyValue, 0&)
 
'This sets the command line for the application
 
sKeyName = appName
 
sKeyValue = appPath & " %1"
 
ret& = RegCreateKey&(HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, sKeyName, lphKey&)
 
ret& = RegSetValue&(lphKey&, "shell\open\command", REG_SZ,
_
 
sKeyValue, MAX_PATH)
End
Sub
And that's it! Use the AssociateFile
function to associate any sort of file extension with your application.
For example, to associate files
with an extension ".lst" with a program called ListViewer, simply use the
code below:
Call AssociateFile
( ".lst", "ListViewer", "c:\ListViewer\LViewer.exe", "List Viewer Application"
)
