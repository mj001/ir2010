Detecting when the Font is changed in an ActiveX Control

I was asked how to do this by a user of this site, and I noticed that the answer seemed
 a little more interesting than it did at first.
 
First there are two interesting things to this one:
 
 
 
 Visual Basic does not expose an event that gets fired when
 the user changes the font on your ActiveX control. You have to declare the StdFont on your
 own and use WithEvents so you have access to the FontChanged Event it exposes. 
 
 
 
 If you assign one StdFont to another it will not assign all
 the attributes, you will only get the font name, and not the size, or other attributes.
 That is why it is necessary to assign each in the Set Font Property.
Dim WithEvents mFont As StdFont
Private Sub UserControl_Initialize()
 Set mFont = New StdFont
 Set UserControl.Font = mFont
End Sub
Public Property Get Font() As StdFont
 Set Font = mFont
End Property
Public Property Set Font(mNewFont As StdFont)
 With mFont
 .Bold = mNewFont.Bold
 .Italic = mNewFont.Italic
 .Name = mNewFont.Name
 .Size = mNewFont.Size
 End With
 
 PropertyChanged "Font"
End Property
Private Sub mFont_FontChanged(ByVal PropertyName As String)
 Set UserControl.Font = mFont
 Refresh
End Sub
