 MenuInfo: Displays
 application menu structures
MenuInfo is a
 another rather simple utility developed to view the entire menu structure of any visible
 application.
 
 MenuInfo lists an application's current menu structure in a hierarchical format. The list
 includes submenu handles/menu item Ids, each item's position within it's parent menu, each
 item's text including it's mnemonic and any access keys associated with the items. An
 array of pertinent properties for each listed menu item can be selectively displayed. The
 list can also be saved to file.
 
 MenuInfo will not retrieve an application's Command bar information. First public release.
