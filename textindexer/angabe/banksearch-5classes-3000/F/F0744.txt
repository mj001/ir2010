When I got a hold of "Sams Teach Yourself C# in 21 Days" book by Bradley L. Jones I expected to learn the basics of
C# language since this was may first book on a .Net language. I had chance to read some introductory books on .Net topics.
The book is a Beginner-Intermediate one and the style it used to present the material was quit appropriate. Every chapter had a specific
topic and examples were representative enough to make the point. As an experienced programmer and reader of some of advanced
books I tried to skim over portions of the book that repeated; like when explaining examples from the beginning as if a reader never
read about it. I missed Wrox's style of introducing new constructs where they just show or emphasize new points. Anyway I couldn't
resist reading all the material because I expected to find small, subtle points in the text since everything was pretty new to me.
In the beginning I didn't like the line numbering of sample code, but later I realized it was appropriate when referring to a particular statement
or a range of code being explained. 
Coming closer to the end of the book I expected to move from a console type application to
a GUI (Windows) based one, and I wasn't disappointed. The author managed to satisfy my curiosity with a few examples of each of
application types C# can create. The author stressed a few times through the book that full books can be written on topics like
.Net base class library, Web services, XML and other topics. I realized I was just at the very beginning in my quest of .Net mastering.
Overall the book fulfilled my desire to understand the basics of the newborn language called C#.
