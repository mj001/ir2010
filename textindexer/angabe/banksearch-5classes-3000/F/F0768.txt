 UndocShell: A demo of a
 dozen undocumented Shell32.dll functions
 
 This example provides names, descriptions and VB calling syntax for 12 functions found in
 the Shell32.dll dynamic link library which are undocumented by Microsoft. These functions
 are exported only by ordinal number and are not directly callable by name. As a result,
 they have been labeled in their DLL declare statements to accurately depict the respective
 operations performed. 
 
 Included are four system dialog functions: SHRestartSystemMB, SHShutDownDialog,
 SHRunDialog, SHChangeIconDialog; and various file system related functions including
 SHFileExists and SHGetShortPathName.
