My VB.NET book available on Amazon for under $19 
 
 
 
 
 
 Please check out my book if you want to learn VB.NET. It is quite a useful resource that I spent months writing. It uses a visual task-based approach, which seperates each topic into a two page spread of information, with screenshots, detailed introductions, and tips and tricks relating to that topic. Click on for Barnes and Noble's review of the book.

Asynchronous Processing: A Simple Asynchronous Class 
 
 
mod 5/23/2002
 
 
 
 
 
 (By Tony Papadakis) This is the first of four articles covering the basics of asynchronous processing. Many applications today require some level of asynchronous processing by a COM server providing for quick return of control to the client. Programming for this requires more planning on the part of the programmer, but can yield a better user experience and, where many tasks have to be completed at once, a better use of computing resources.

Collection Classes on the Web 
 
 
mod 4/25/2002
 
 
 
 
 
 Collections are an incredibly useful tool to group large numbers of data classes together for easy access. It allows developers to put related information into classes and put the classes into the collection for easy retrieval as needed. This article covers collection classes as they are typically discussed for standalone applications and how they can be modified for use in web applications.

Designing Relational Databases for Object Hierarchies Using .NET 
 
 
mod 1/17/2002
 
 
 
 
 
 This article by Stephen Hopkins discusses the fact that the problem of placing an object’s state into a relational database is a problem of such significance that it has been given its own name, "impedance mismatch". There are a number of techniques that can be used to overcome the problems, and this article outlines some of them. In particular it deals with object identity, logical deletes, hidden updates and inheritance.
