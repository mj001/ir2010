Although, Microsoft recently introduced yet another metafile format (Windows NT’s Enhanced Metafiles), Placeable Metafiles are currently the most commonly used format for Windows Metafiles. METAFILE.BAS makes it possible for Visual Basic programs to create Placeable Windows Metafiles which may be loaded into other Windows programs.
