 NTEventLog: Windows
 NT/2K event log viewer
 
 Demonstrates the intricacies of extracting every bit of information from the WinNT and
 Win2K event logs, while presenting the results in a series of columns in a VB ListView.
 The code also shows how to convert a binary SID (Security IDentifier) returned in the
 EVENTLOGRECORD UserSid member to its textural representation, see "Q131320 - How
 to Convert a Binary SID to Textual Form"
 
 Note that though this example retrieves Application and System event log entries, it will
 not retrieve Security event log entries without the logged on user having the proper
 security access rights or privileges, see the "Event Logging Security" topic in
 the Platform SDK for more information.
