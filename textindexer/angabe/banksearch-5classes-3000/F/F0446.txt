This tutorial shows some of
the most commonly used API functions. Check this section with frequency,
as we'll be updating it often. If you want to send other functions, e-mail
the webmaster, and your code will be posted here (with any credits). 
 
 
1 - The PaintDesktop Function
This one is very simple! The
syntax is the following:
Declare
Function PaintDesktop Lib
"user32" (ByVal
hdc As Long)
As Long
Afer you place it in a module,
just use Call
PaintDesktop(Form1.hdc) ---- 
where Form1
can be replaced by any Form or PictureBox.
Your desktop image will be painted to the control specified.
 
2 -
To get the Desktop DC
Place
this code at a module:
Declare
Function GetDesktopWindow Lib
"user32" ()
As Long
Declare
Function GetWindowDC
Lib "user32"
(ByVal
hwnd As Long)
As Long
- GetDesktopWindow
returns the handle of the desktop window (Microsoft Windows uses handles
to identify each form and control - but never store them for much time,
as they change very often).
-
GetWindowDC returns
the hDC of any window you request.
OK...
So then you use this code:
Dim
Desktop As Long 
' Variable that will store the Desktop handle
Dim
DesktopDC As Long 
' Variable that will store the Desktop hDC
Desktop
= GetDesktopWindow()
DesktopDC
= GetWindowDC(Desktop)
And now
you have the Desktop DC! You can alter it using SetPixel or BitBlt functions
(soon at the GDI32 Guide), or create a transparent form effect (see the
Tutorials section). Use your imagination!
p.s:
try using GetWindowDC(object.hwnd) - where object can be
a button, a form, an image control, and mostly all other VB controls. You'll
get their DCs and will be able to change them all, printing text, BitBlting,
or using SetPixel.
