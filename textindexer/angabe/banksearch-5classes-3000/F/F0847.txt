Labels
Labels are very simple to understand. Basically they just hold text that appears on the Form.
For example, if you had a picture of your dog on the Form, in the label you would write
something like "My Dog" to describe the pic. Many programmers use labels around textboxes
so the user knows what to put in the textbox... 
 
Label properties:
Alignment - Determines if the label's text is in the middle, towards the right or the left
AutoSize - Sizes the label to fit the text in it perfectly
BackStyle - Determines if the Label is transparent or not
BorderStyle - Determines how the border of the label looks like
Caption - The label's caption
Font - The label's font type
ForeColor - Determines what color the font is
TabIndex - What order the label gets focus
ToolTipText - Holds text that will pop up when the mouse is over the label
Visible - Determines if the control is visible at run time or not
