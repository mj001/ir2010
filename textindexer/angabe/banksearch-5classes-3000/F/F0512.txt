VB6
To add an About Box to your UserControl first create a new form called frmAbout. Then
in your UserControl create a new Procedure:
Public Sub ShowAboutBox()
 frmAbout.Show
End Sub
Now in the UserControl goto the Tools -> Procedure Attributes Menu. In the Name
Combo select ShowAboutBox and then click on the Advanced button. Set the Procedure ID
ComboBox to AboutBox and then click ok.
Now when your UserControl is hosted on a form one of the Properties in the properties
window will be named About and have the button with the three ellipses. When clicked the
button will open frmAbout.
