	PDF Converter 
	 
	Create PDF Documents from Any Windows Application 
	From AMYUNI Consultants 
	 
	
 
The PDF Converter or Printer Driver allows you to create a PDF document from any application running under Windows operating systems. It can be installed on your system like any printer driver. An automatic installation software is provided for an even easier installation. Instead of printing to your standard printer, you just select the PDF Converter printer to generate a PDF file from your output. The PDF Converter Developer License allows you to distribute a special version of the driver with your application like any DLL or ActiveX with no royalties.

as you wish (ex: MyPDFGenerator) will be visible only while your application is active.

	Product Review:
	
The Magic of PDF
The world of documentation has quickly embraced two standards - HTML and PDF. Although HTML is a universal standard, it falls short when formatted and paginated output is a requirement. When a printed document has to look like the way it was designed, PDF is usually the only universally accepted choice. That's where PDF Converter comes in.
Creating PDFs PDQ
PDF Converter is a software suite that creates PDFs from any application that can print under Windows. Additionally, it also exposes interfaces to drive the creation of PDF documents from within the Visual Studio environment with minimal code. It's easy to install, and it even includes installation software.
No-Worries Distribution
Stringent licensing could have limited the usefulness of this product, but AMYUNI Consultants has avoided that problem by allowing royalty-free distribution of applications using PDF Converter, so long as all PDF document properties are set within the application without a user interface.
PDF Converter is a much-needed product for the development environment, this is a must have. Order today!
- Simple printer driver to create PDF documents from Windows applications
