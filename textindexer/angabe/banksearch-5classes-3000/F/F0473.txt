Collision Detection
One of the most important aspects
that may be considered in a game is collision detection. Most tutorials
over the Internet try to explain it using the IntersectRect API - but here
we'll use a different method.
Image we have a Sprite type
simillar to this:
Type
Sprite
X
As Integer
Y
As Integer
Width
As Integer
Height
As Integer
End Type
Now take a look at the following
code:
Public
Function Collision(spr1
As Sprite, spr2 As
Sprite) As Boolean
Collision
= True 
' Sets the collision as True
'Now we
see if the collision is impossible:
If
spr1.X + spr1.Width spr2.X + spr2.Width Then
Collision = False
If spr1.Y
+ spr1.Height spr2.Y + spr2.Height Then
Collision = False
End Function
Well, that's it! If you want
to check if two sprites collide, just use the function above as shown below:
If
Collision(Hero, Enemy) Then
' Code
if Hero and Enemy collide
Else
'Code
if don't
End If
