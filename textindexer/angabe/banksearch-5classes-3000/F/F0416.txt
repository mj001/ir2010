	Item Comparison

- Standard - Includes 32 bit OCX, single developer license, online docs. 
- Professional - Everything from Standard plus support for MS Word 97 and 2000, hyperlinks, headers and footers, drag&drop, DLL interface (low-level API).
Enterprise XML - 
TX Text Control Enterprise/XML is a new XML based version of TX Text Control. It enables non-technical users to work in a typical word processor like environment, yet create valid XML documents. Many applications can benefit from using XML instead of one of the classic text formats like RTF.
Features:
- WYSIWYG XML editor 
- Easy to use, word processor-like user interface 
- CSS Stylesheets 
- Input validated with DTD 
- Rich set of properties for manipulation of XML and CSS structures from code 
- Convert XML to HTML, RTF, DOC

Word in a Box
 Remember the last time you wanted to provide editing functionality in your VB application but gave up? The Rich Text control doesn't cut it, because it doesn't give users all the features they expect from big-brand names like Microsoft Word. What once sufficed in terms of formatting options now also needs OLE embedding, headers and footers, drag and drop, tables, and spell checking. Ready to pull out that VB Control Creator book and start programming 24 hours a day for the next five years? With TX Text Control you can create a "My Word" application, rich with advanced word processing features, in a matter of minutes. What's more, TX Text Control comes with great sample programs, so you don't need to be a VB whiz to get your first application up and running. 
Text Layout
 TX Text Control can be used as an OCX or directly, using the functions exported by its DLL. As an OCX, it can be dropped onto a VB form (or any other ActiveX host) and used almost immediately as a powerful RTF editor. What's more, it accepts images, OLE objects, formatted text, and lots of other features you would expect to find only in the best off-the-shelf word processing packages. The most valuable feature of our test application was tables, and TX Text Control handled them admirably - with a variable number of columns, ruler-based sizing, and even custom borders and shading on the table. 
 Text entered within a TX Text Control instance can be formatted at both character level and paragraph level - complete with text foreground and background colors, super and sub scripting, line spacing, and indents. The user interface is clean and easy to understand - especially for those already familiar with Microsoft Word. 
Document Format Support
 TX Text Control easily opens RTF, Word 6 to Word 2000 DOC, TXT, and HTML files, as well as files stored in its own proprietary format. TX Text Control documents saved in RTF, for example, can easily be opened with Microsoft Word or Wordpad. And, although it's not an HTML editor, it can edit and save HTML files, retaining their original formatting. 
Spell Checking
 A customized version of VSSPELL from VideoSoft is available for TX Text Control as an add-in. Containing an extensive 250,000+ word American English dictionary, VSSPELL can be used as a traditional spell checker, checking the document in one pass, or it can underline misspelled words on the fly, using the modern concept of check-while-you-type. And VSSPELL can run in TX Text Control with just two lines of code! 
- Rich Microsoft Word-like word processing component in an OCX, complete with tables, RTF, HTML and OLE embedding 
- Zoom in/out 
- Database support 
- Unicode and multi-language support 
- Numerous ready-to-use dialog boxes 
- Unlimited text length
