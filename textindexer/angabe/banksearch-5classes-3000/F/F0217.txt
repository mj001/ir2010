	<font size=4><div class=cutline>Product Review:</div></font><BR>
	<font size='-1'><h4>Another Triumph</h4> Crystal Reports<sup>&reg;</sup> makes it easy for me to create rich, interactive content from virtually any data source, publish it to the Web, or integrate it into my applications! Using the Report Designer Component (RDC), I can integrate reports into my applications and access royalty-free runtime calls for unprecedented control over the reporting engine. I can create, view, and modify reports directly within my VB IDE using familiar VB code. And the Embeddable Designer Control delivers a visual interface for drag-and-drop design of reports you can embed into applications so that users can design their own reports (additional licensing required). <h4>Build and Deliver</h4> Now I have one core application for both Windows and web applications - a real time-saver. For Visual InterDev, I can use Report Integration Controls to write ASP apps with integrated Crystal Reports<sup>&reg;</sup>. I can also deliver reports in XML, DHTML, PDF, RTF, and Excel. The customizable DHTML Viewer integrates fully with my ActiveX, Java, or zero-client applications, while the data access driver provides XML export/import support for enhanced web information delivery. <h4>Powerful Content</h4> Powerful, presentation-quality reporting is easier and more flexible with Crystal Reports<sup>&reg;</sup>' new report styles, charts, mapping, drill-down, alerting and parameter prompts. Hyperlinks support lets me create compelling, interactive documents or web content. Better still, the extensive formula language allows for full control over report formatting, even when working with complex business logic and data selection. <ul> <li>Order your copy with Upgrade Advantage Maintenance to receive all product enhancements for one year.
