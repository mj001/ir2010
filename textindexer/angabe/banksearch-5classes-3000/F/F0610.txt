 SHChangeNotify: An
 example of how to *receive* shell change notifications
 
 We have the FindFirst/NextChangeNotification APIs that tell us when something changes in
 the physical file system. But what about the changes that happen in virtual folders
 implemented by namespace extension that aren't part of the physical file system? How does
 an Explorer window get updated when a new printer is added in the Printers folder, or a
 connection is deleted in the Dial-Up Networking folder?
 
 Enter the undocumented API functions SHChangeNotifyRegister and SHChangeNotifyDeregister.
 This demo shows how an application can use these functions to register itself with the
 shell, allowing the application to be notified of any specified changes that were made in
 any specified part of the namespace, from the desktop folder on down. The demo also
 provides a rather interesting study of what is actually happening in the namespace as
 well...
 
 Please note, use undocumented functions with care. There's no telling when they won't work
 anymore...
