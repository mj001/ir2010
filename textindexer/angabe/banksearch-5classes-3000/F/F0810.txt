Keeping your skills at the leading edge
Most successful IT professionals share a common
desire to keep their skills up to date and to get the best available rates for the most
challenging and interesting assignments available. Keeping your skills up to date is
no easy task as the rate of technology change can be rapid and sometimes
mind-bogling. New versions of developement tools are frequently being released,
brand new technologies are emerging every day, new bugs are being discovered. Unless
you are constanly upgrading and retraining, you could find yourself stale within six
months. Also, if you always do only what you're expert at, the skill is soon
outdated and you are no longer marketable. Here are some of the resources that can help
you keep your skills at the leading edge.
Just getting started
If you are new to this field, it can get very confusing
trying to figure out where to start. There are many training courses and books out
there promising great results. Sometimes it is hard to tell which ones are valuable
and which ones are just a waste of time? Here are some suggestions on where to get started.
Finding the right career
If you are in technology business, you should consider
yourself fortunate. The media keeps telling us that there is a great shortage of
skilled IT labour in North America and that it is difficult for many companies to find and
keep good people. However, finding that next great assignment or even a full-time
job is not always that easy. There are several ways of looking for one including
personal networking, employment agencies or even on-line job search boards.
