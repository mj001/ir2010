Quick Crash Course

I thought this book was a great little tool to get me started with ASP.NET.
This was my first time reading the "Sams Teach Yourself..." series and for
those of us who are thrown in to the lions den from time to time, (I guess
that's most of us) it's a great way to take a quick crash course on a topic.
Having said that, I don't think I'd recommend this book to an ASP newbie
because it's too highlevel to really ground you in understanding the
technology. For those of you who are looking for a step by step guide to
learning ASP, I'd personally recommend you shop around for something else.
Even though some of the topics covered in this book are at times too basic
for the seasoned web programmer, (for example in the first few chapters,
they talk about what variables are, conditional statements and looping logic
etc.) it does a good job of providing an overview of the new ASP.NET
language.
 
What's great about the way the book is organized is the fact that there are
workshops at the end of each lesson with the answers on the same page. This
worked well for me because I was trying to rewrite some old code in ASP.NET
and didn't always have the time to read an entire chapter to find out how to
do something. 
Something else I appreciated about it was the fact that the examples they
used were actually useful and practical. 
Overall, it's a pretty good read.
