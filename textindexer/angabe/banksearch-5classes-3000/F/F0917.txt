If you are posting code, surround it with [code] [/code] tags - it helps preserve the formatting and spacing.
We are about to re-write our VB6 and VFP applications in VB.NET, and will be using the SQL Server 2000 data engine. We have the following questions
about the VB.NET Data Grid control
1. How to format individual cells in a grid (Date, Currency, etc.)
2. Is it possible to have empty records in a grid?
3. Is it possible to return a data set with no records, but just headers?
Thanks in advance to anyone for any assistance.
