Lesson 12: Creating VB Functions For MS Excel
12.2 The Needs to Create User-Defined Functions in MS-Excel
You can create your own functions to supplement the built-in
functions in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which are quite limited. These
functions could be very useful and powerful if you know how to program
them properly. One main reason we need to create user defined functions
is to enable us to customize our spreadsheet environment for individual
needs. For example, we might need a function that could calculate commissions
payment based on the sales volume, which is quite difficult if not impossible
by using the built-in function alone. Lets look at the table below:
Table 12.1: Commissions Payment Table
Sales Volume($)
 
Commissons
 
5000
 
15%
 
In the above table, if a saleman attain a sale volume of $6000,
he will be paid $6000x12%=$720.00. A visual basic function to calculate
the commissions could be written as
follows:
Function Comm(Sales_V As Variant) as Variant
If Sales_V =500 and Sales_V=1000 and Sales_V=200 and Sales_V=5000 Then
Comm=Sales_V*0.15
End If
End Function
12.2 Using Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Editor
To create User Defined functions in MS Excel, you can click on
tools, select macro and then click on Visual Basic Editor as shown in Figure
12.1
 
 
 
Figure 12.1: Inserting Ms_Excel Visual Basic Editor
Upon clicking the Visual Basic Editor, the VB Editor windows will appear
as shown in figure 12.2. To create a function, type in the function as
illustrated in section 12.1 above After typing, save the
 file and then return to the Excel windows.
Figure 12.2 : The VB Editor
 
 
 In the Excel windows, type in the titles Sales Volume and Commissions
in any two cells. By refering to figure 12.3, key-in the Comm function
at cell C4 and by referencing the value in cell B4, using the format Comm(B4).
Any value appear in cell B4 will pass the value to the Comm function in
cell C4. For the rest of the rows, just copy the formula by draging 
the bottom right corner of cell C4 to the required cells, and a nice and
neat table that show the commisions will automatically appear. It can also
be updated anytime
