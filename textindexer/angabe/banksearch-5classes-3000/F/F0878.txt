 Tooltip: Dynamically
 create a real tooltip common control at runtime
 
 This example contains a class that show how to dynamically create a fully functional
 tooltip common control at runtime, while implementing some of the control's basic
 functionality: individual tools, each with their own unique text, can be assigned to any
 VB control window; tooltip text can be displayed on more than one line with any text color
 or tooltip window background color; and the tooltip window can be displayed for any given
 period of time.
