Showing a Window without Activating it

VB6
Declaring the API
To acomplish this task we need to declare the ShowWindow API. This API when 
called will show our window, and the activation depends on the second parameter, 
which we will use SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE.
Private Declare Function ShowWindow Lib "user32" (ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal nCmdShow As Long) As Long
Private Const SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE = 4
Example Usage
To use this API just call it like shown below. You can use any form you like as 
long as you can access its hWND property.Private Sub Form_Load()
 ShowWindow Me.hWnd, SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE
End Sub
