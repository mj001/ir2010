**** Article: ADO+ Guides the Evolution of the Data Species by Dino Esposito In one of the first articles about what is now known as ADO.NET, Dino shows how COM Marshalling was a limiting factor with ADO because only COM objects could use ADO recordsets. ADO.NET utilises XML as the universal transmission format which means that any application or web service that can read XML can participate.

Web Services
***** Web Services Description Language (1.0) When you write your web service, you'll obviously want people to be able to reference it and use the services that you have to offer (often for a fee). This is the full version of WSDL 1.0 explaining how your web service is described in XML.
**** IDL to WSDL Converter When describing Web Services you'll use SDL or WSDL to describe the services that your components provide. This is a parallel to way that typelibraries worked in classic COM and COM+. This neat little tool, will take the IDL file and produce WSDL and WSML without the need for a DLL or TLB file.
 My First Web Service In this article, Graham Parker - VBUG Chairman, takes you through building a HelloWorld Web Service.
