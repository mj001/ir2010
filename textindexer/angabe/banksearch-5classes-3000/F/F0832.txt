A high-level overview of the new and field of XML Web Services 
Reviewed By: George Klissarov 
This book is a high-level overview of the new and field of XML Web Services - 
as they are implemented the Microsoft way. It targets the intermediate to 
advanced developer who is new to that field. The introductory chapter, "Web 
Service Fundamentals”, provides an overview of this new technology and explains 
why it is the future of the software development. The following chapters are 
dedicated to the specifications, standards and technologies behind XML Web 
Services. Included are crash courses on XML, XPath, XLink, XSL, SOAP, WSDL and 
UDDI. The rest of the book demonstrates and discusses .Net sample code in C#. 
Covered are all fundamental areas necessary to build, expose and consume a Web 
Service. The reader is briefly introduced to web service security, 
authentication, authorization and design best practices. 
This book will be valuable to you if you already have a good understanding of 
the .NET architecture and some familiarity with C#. If you like learning new 
concepts by studying source code samples this book will give you a good base to 
start from. Because of the wide range of topics covered within the limited 
volume of the book, you may find some discussions to be somewhat difficult. If 
this happens to you, Appendix D provides a comprehensive list of additional .NET 
web service resources.
