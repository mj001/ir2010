A Spreadsheet/Grid for All Seasons
 Are your users clamoring for spreadsheet features in your app, but you don't have the time or the desire to automate Excel? There aren't many "spreadsheets in an OCX," but FarPoint's Spread is one of the first and one of the best. 
 Spread gives you most of the power of Excel with a much easier to use API/object model, having been designed for use by a programmer rather than as a spreadsheet application. You have full control over the look and feel, including the ability to include formulas directly in the cells (like a spreadsheet!) without the need for code in your program. You can set colors, combine rows and cells, insert headers, background, and cell images, basically everything you might imagine you'd need and more. 
Take Your App "Outside the Box" 
 Spread supports a proprietary import/export data format for saving data or data plus spreadsheet formatting and formulas, so you could even distribute updates to your program without ever having to recompile your program. How cool is that? 
Excel Even Without Excel
 Of course, Spread can directly read and write Excel 97/2000 formatted data, so you can produce a spreadsheet that can be used by almost any spreadsheet user without using Excel. This means your app can work with properly formatted spreadsheet files without depending on the presence of Excel. You can also read and write delimited text files, and even export HTML files - the properties you set in your spreadsheet to control look and feel become attributes of your HTML table, right down to exporting any pictures you include within the cells as properly formatted JPG files. 
Easy to Print and Report
 Spread's printing support helps eliminate the pain of printing spreadsheets. A very easy-to-use Print control makes the whole thing easy as pie. You can print one spreadsheet, or combine spreadsheets and parts of spreadsheets, including graphics. You can even use the Spread Designer to help you set up printing which makes the whole thing a piece of cake! 
Easy to Spread, Too
 As you might imagine, Spread 6 has many properties, methods, and events. But don't worry - the help file is top of the line, and the very useful Spread Designer makes working with the control in design mode simply a matter of clicking off options and, well, designing a spreadsheet. FarPoint also includes very useful sample applications that demonstrate many of the more complex features of the control, including the print preview/report writer functionality and combining Spread with XML. 
- Fully featured bound or unbound grid 
- Built in "Spread Designer" to use with your spreadsheet and reports 
- Built in support for printing/print preview 
- Reads/writes Excel, delimited text, and Spread formatted data
