CSocket class - replacement 
 for the MS Winsock Control
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Download 
 FTP Client sample project with CSocket class 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Version: 1.0.6 Last Modified: 
 08-JULY-2002
 
 
Download CSocket-106.zip
 
Major change: Since version 1.0.6 the class 
 doesn't try to resolve IP address into domain name while connecting, in 
 the case when a valid IP address string has been assigned to the 
 RemoteHost property.
 
 
What the hell is this?
 
 
This is an attempt to simulate 
 functionality and behavior of the 
 MS Winsock ActiveX Control. Why do I call it "an attempt"? Because I 
 don't know what exactly is going on inside that control. I can suppose 
 which Winsock API functions are called by the control's methods but I 
 don't know a lot of other things in the control implementation. Anyway 
 the class does work. To prove it, I just have ported the existing 
 project - FTP Client Sample Application. Download and see it yourself. 
 
There are several reasons why we 
 in need of such an "only VB code solution" that exposes almost exactly 
 the same interface as the MS Winsock Control. The main reason is that we 
 have no ability to develop VB classes that utilize the Winsock Control. 
 At the first sight, it is possible to use the control as a windowless 
 library, but it works only on the development systems that do have a 
 development license installed for this control. 
 
 
Implementation
 
 
I'm not going to discuss the class implementation 
 here. Source code of the class contains a lot of green lines of text that (I 
 hope) explain what is going on. However, to understand the class 
 implementation you should know and understand a lot of advanced things 
 that I have no possibility to explain in a single article. So wait for 
 more tutorials on the advanced Winsock API techniques or read the 
 documentation and books and to try to get the knowledge, if you cannot 
 wait for my explanations. 
 
Frankly, the reason I published this project now is 
 that I hope to get constructive response from you. I expect that some 
 one will replace the Winsock Control with the CSocket class in an 
 existing working project and find out some problems this that.
 
 
Dependencies
 
 
Unfortunately, the CSocket class has got a dependency 
 - MSocketSupport code module. You have no chance to use the class 
 without that module. I think it is not a big price.
 
 
Beware - the interface is changed
 
 
The CSocket class has the same interface as the 
 Winsock Control except several members. See the table below:
