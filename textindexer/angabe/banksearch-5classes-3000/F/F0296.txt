User Agreement Terms and Conditions
1. General
1.1 This agreement governs your use of the web sites (the "Sites") operated by Northstar Computer Systems (NCS).
Additional terms and conditions of use applicable to specific areas of the Sites may 
also be posted in such areas and, together with this agreement, govern your use of those areas. This agreement, together 
with any such additional term and conditions, are referred to as this "Agreement."
1.2 NCS reserves the right, in its discretion, to change or modify all or any part of this 
Agreement at any time, effective immediately upon notice published on the Sites. Your continued use 
of the Sites constitutes your binding acceptance of these terms and conditions, including any changes 
or modifications made by NCS as permitted above. If at any time the terms and conditions of this Agreement 
are no longer acceptable to you, you should immediately cease all use of the Sites.
1.3 The Sites is directed to teenagers and adults and is not directed to children under the age 
of 13. NCS complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and does not permit registration 
by and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. This requirement 
will be posted wherever NCS collects data within the Sites, such as during the registration process.
2. Use of Content
2.1 You acknowledge that the Sites contains information, software, photographs, audio and video clips, 
graphics, links and other material (collectively, the "Content") that are protected by copyright, trademark or 
other proprietary rights of NCS or third parties. All Content on the Sites is copyrighted as a collective work 
of NCS pursuant to applicable copyright law. You agree to comply with any additional copyright notices, 
information, or restrictions contained in any Content available on or accessed through the Sites. Users of 
the Sites may use the Content only for their personal, noncommercial use.
2.2 You may not modify, publish, transmit, transfer or sell, reproduce, create derivative works from, 
distribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit any of the Content, in whole or in part, except as expressly 
permitted in this Agreement. Content consisting of downloadable software may not be reverse engineered unless 
specifically authorized by the owner of the software's patent and/or copyright. You may post on the Sites any 
Content owned by you (such as your original statements), Content for which you have received express permission 
from the owner and Content in the public domain. You assume all risk and responsibility for determining whether 
any Content is in the public domain. You grant to NCS the right to edit, copy, publish, distribute, translate 
and otherwise use in any medium any Content that you place on the Sites without compensation to you. You represent 
and warrant that you are authorized to grant all rights set forth in the preceding sentence.
2.3 You may download or copy the Content only for your own personal use, provided that you maintain all 
copyright and other notices contained in such Content. You shall not store electronically any significant portion 
of any Content. Except as expressly permitted by the copyright laws, no copying, storage, redistribution or publication 
of any Content is permitted without the express permission of NCS or the owners of such Content or their authorized 
persons, if other than NCS. You may download from the Sites any Content in the public domain for your own personal 
use or for non-commercial redistribution.

harassing or threatening, (b) contains viruses or other contaminating or destructive features, (c) violates the 
rights of others, such as Content which infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or violates any 
right of privacy or publicity, or (d) otherwise violates any applicable law. You may not post on the Sites any 
links to any external Internet sites that are obscene or pornographic. You shall not use the Sites for any 
commercial purpose, to distribute any advertising or solicitation of funds or goods and Sitess or to solicit

However, NCS reserves the right to delete, move or edit any Content (including Content posted in any Interactive Area) 
that it may determine, in its sole discretion, violates this Agreement or is otherwise unacceptable. You shall 
remain solely responsible for all Content posted by you. NCS shall have the right, but not the obligation, to 
correct any errors or omissions in any Content, as it may determine in its sole discretion.
5. No Endorsement
5.1 NCS does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any Content posted on any Interactive 
Area and you acknowledge that any reliance upon such Content shall be at your sole risk. Any Content placed on 
any Interactive Area by users are the views of the user posting the statement, and do not represent the views of NCS.
5.2 The Sites may contain links to sites on the Internet which are owned and operated by third parties 
(the "External Sites"). You acknowledge that NCS is not responsible for the availability of, or the content 
located on or through, any External Site. You should contact the site administrator or Webmaster for those 
External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or the content located on such External Sites.
6. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold NCS and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, owners, 
agents, information providers and licensors (collectively, the "NCS Parties") harmless from and against any and 
all claims, liability, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by any NCS Party in 
connection with any use or alleged use of the Sites under your password by any person, whether or not authorized 
by you. NCS reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter 
otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with NCS's defense of such claim.
7. Termination of Sites
NCS reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to restrict, suspend or terminate your access to all or any part 
of the Sites, including the Interactive Areas, at any time for any reason without prior notice or liability. 
NCS may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspect of the Sites at any time, including the availability 
of any feature, database, or Content (including the Interactive Areas), without prior notice or liability.
8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
8.1 NEITHER NCS NOR ANY PROVIDER OF THIRD PARTY CONTENT OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS WARRANTS THAT THE SITES

 ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. NONE OF NCS, THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE 
 AGENTS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE 
 OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SITES, ANY CONTENT 
 OR ANY PRODUCTS OR SITESS SOLD THROUGH THE SITES. NEITHER NCS NOR ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDER WARRANTS THAT ANY 
 FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING THROUGH THE SITES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE 
 FEATURES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SITES AND THE ACCURACY 
 OR COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENT IS ASSUMED SOLELY BY YOU.
8.2 NEITHER NCS, ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDER NOR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, 
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES, EVEN

8.3 SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, THE LIABILITY 
OF NCS, THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
9. Miscellaneous
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Virginia, and the parties irrevocably 
consent to bring any action to enforce this Agreement in the federal or state courts located in Virginia. This 
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and 
supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. 
If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted 
on the Sites, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, 
the additional terms and conditions shall control. Sections 2, 3, 7, 8, 10 and 11 shall survive any termination 
of this Agreement as well as any other provisions which by their terms or sense are intended to survive.
