	<font size=4><div class=cutline>Product Review:</div></font><BR>
	<font size='-1'><h4>Jam-packed!</h4> True DBGrid Pro 6.0 won the latest VBxtras Thunderbolt Award for best grid component, so you may be wondering, like me, what the good folks at APEX - now ComponentOne - could possibly add to this grid control in version 7.0. Well, they've struck gold again, coming up with even more enhancements to suit the most sophisticated developer. <h4>Feature after Feature</h4> Tops on the list of new 7.0 features is the fully editable, drop-down hierarchical grid that displays enhanced Master-Detail relationships. You can also tell that a lot of effort went into adding outstanding data presentation features, such as an enhanced style object that lets you customize border appearance, size, color, and type. True DBGrid Pro 7.0 also has two new data views - FormView and InvertedView - that let you present data the way you want to. <p> But wait - there's even more! Keyboard navigation is better than ever. There are several new print and print preview options. And with the new SpringMode, columns automatically resize. True DBGrid Pro 7.0 also features Excel-style cell selection; easy to use dropdowns with automatic text completion; extended column object capabilities; support for Windows 2000 COM Redirection; and automatic grid cell translation to True DBDropDown values. True DBGrid Pro 7.0 is also fully compatible with Visual InterDevÅ. <h4>Your Wish List Is Now a Reality</h4> ComponentOne also listened to developers to find out what additional features you'd like to have. As a result, True DBGrid Pro 7.0 now offers scroll tracking and scroll tips, as well as right-to-left support. There's also a filter bar interface that lets you customize filtering and formatting. And for you users of their True DataControl tool, this version of True DBGrid Pro offers cross-tab functionality and OLAP (pivot table) support so you can look at data in different ways at run-time. <h4>Need We Say More?</h4> Whew! I wasn't kidding when I said True DBGrid Pro 7.0 was jam-packed! Order your copy today! <ul> <li>Fully editable, drop-down hierarchical grid <li>New print and print preview options <li>Dropdowns with automatic text completion and automatic grid cell translation <li>Cross-tab functionality <li>OLAP support </ul></font>
