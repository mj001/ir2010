	Product Review:
	
A New Window on Installation
 Installing your own code or customizing others' setup routines for your environment is not fun. But Wise for Windows Installer eliminates the laborious script editing and antiquated "wizards" in development tools. This rock-solid upgrade for Windows Installer setups adds .NET support, script customizations to MSIs, MSIDiff to review differences in scripts, and several enhancements to existing features. 
 WFWI's unique design approach guides you through a taskpad view. You can jump around the installation wizard from key package files to installation parameters to supporting documents and files. The wizard suggests but rarely forces you into a decision, so you have complete control. 
Deployment Is Key
 WFWI Professional lets you deploy updates to your software off shared locations or the Internet, deploy your product for installation directly off your website without reliance upon large setup engines, and source-control version changes to your deployments using PVCS, SourceSafe, or other tools. 
It's in the Script
 When you just want to use time-tested scripts, WFWI lets you download merge modules directly from Wise or other supporting vendors. For tuning others' setup routines, you simply setupcapture a before and after into your own script, or just transform another Windows Installer-based package to your own, new WFWI package. You can also digitally sign your installation and provide it in one of five supported languages 
- Both editions support .NET; Professional adds support for MTS/COM+ and 64-bit installations
