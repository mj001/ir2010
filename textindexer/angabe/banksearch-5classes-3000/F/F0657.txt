 ProgressBar: Example of
 how to create a progress bar common control
 
 This example shows how to dynamically create a fully functional progress bar common
 control exposed by the common control library comctl32.dll at runtime without the use of
 comctl32.ocx.
 
 The advantages of this implementation are obviously beneficial. First and foremost the
 need to distribute comctl32.ocx with an application is eliminated, reducing distribution
 size. Also an application's memory footprint is significantly reduced by not loading an
 ActiveX control. And finally, there is a noticeable improvement in performance. And that's
 why I wrote it, but...
 
 There is one drawback here though. There are no stock VB mouse events to work with as are
 provided by comctl32.ocx. To work around this, you can implement your own events via
 either a subclassing control in VB4 or the AddressOf operator in VB5.
