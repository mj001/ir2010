Making a Form stay on Top
 
Rolling a Form Up and Down
These two subs can be used to roll a form up and down.
Sub RollFormUp(frm As Form, up As Integer)
'Rolls a form up. Pay attention to the form's scalemode
'property. If it's set to pixels and you use a twip value,
'for example, your form will roll during an eternity!
'up - the amount you want the form to be rolled up
Dim UntilCond
UntilCond = frm.Height - up
If UntilCond Then Exit Sub
If up Exit Sub
Do
frm.Height = frm.Height - 1
DoEvents
Loop Until frm.Height 
End Sub
Sub RollFormDown(frm As Form, down As Integer)
'Rolls a form down. Again, pay attention to the scalemode!
'down is the amount you may want your form to be rolled down
Dim UntilCond
UntilCond = frm.Height + down
If down Then Exit Sub
Do
frm.Height = frm.Height + 1
DoEvents
Loop Until frm.Height >= UntilCond
End Sub
