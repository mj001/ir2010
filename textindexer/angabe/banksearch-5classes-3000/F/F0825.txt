Printing
Printing is pretty easy, but yet can be complicated. VB has many properties for the Print object, you can customize your prints. You have to take many factors into consideration.
 Note: There is no control for Printing
Printer. Properties:
ColorMode - Sets the color mode
Copies - Sets the number of copies to print
DrawMode - Determines the graphics to draw on the printer
Page - Has the page number currently being printed
Port - Specifies the port
PrintQuality - Determines the print quality
Printer. Methods
EndDoc - Sends out the document to the print spooler
KillDoc - Terminates the output, and deletes the print
Print - Prints
Your Code might look something like this;
 Printer.Print "age"
 Printer.EndDoc
or maybe
 Printer.Print Lable1.Caption
 Printer.Print Lable2.Caption
 Printer.EndDoc
Those are just the basics to printing w/ VB... Hmm were almost done.
