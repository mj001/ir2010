 ScrollView: A
 UserControl becomes a natural scrollable viewport
 
 Demonstrates how to turn a UserControl into a real scrollable viewport. Once the size of
 the view in the UserControl is established, scrollbars are added to it by setting its
 WS_H/VSCROLL window styles. When corresponding WM_H/VSCROLL messages are received, the
 control's window origin and DC are offset with the OffsetWindowOrgEx and ScrollWindowEx
 APIs respectively, allowing both graphics and child contained controls to be scrolled
 seamlessly within the UserControl's window.
