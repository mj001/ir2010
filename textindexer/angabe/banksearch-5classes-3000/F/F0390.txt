Changing
the System Colors
 
You can globally change any
Windows 95 desktop colour using the SetSysColors function. It takes three
parameters : The number of colour elements to change, The Color object
constant that you want to change and the RGB value.
The Declaration for this
API function is:
Declare
Function SetSysColors Lib "user32" Alias _
"SetSysColors"
(ByVal nChanges As Long, lpSysColor As _
Long,
lpColorValues As Long) As Long 
 
The Constants are:
Public
Const COLOR_SCROLLBAR = 0 'The Scrollbar colour 
Public
Const COLOR_BACKGROUND = 1 'Colour of the background with no wallpaper 
Public
Const COLOR_ACTIVECAPTION = 2 'Caption of Active Window 
Public
Const COLOR_INACTIVECAPTION = 3 'Caption of Inactive window 
Public
Const COLOR_MENU = 4 'Menu 
Public
Const COLOR_WINDOW = 5 'Windows background 
Public
Const COLOR_WINDOWFRAME = 6 'Window frame 
Public
Const COLOR_MENUTEXT = 7 'Window Text 
Public
Const COLOR_WINDOWTEXT = 8 '3D dark shadow (Win95) 
Public
Const COLOR_CAPTIONTEXT = 9 'Text in window caption 
Public
Const COLOR_ACTIVEBORDER = 10 'Border of active window 
Public
Const COLOR_INACTIVEBORDER = 11 'Border of inactive window 
Public
Const COLOR_APPWORKSPACE = 12 'Background of MDI desktop 
Public
Const COLOR_HIGHLIGHT = 13 'Selected item background 
Public
Const COLOR_HIGHLIGHTTEXT = 14 'Selected menu item 
Public
Const COLOR_BTNFACE = 15 'Button 
Public
Const COLOR_BTNSHADOW = 16 '3D shading of button 
Public
Const COLOR_GRAYTEXT = 17 'Grey text, of zero if dithering is used. 
Public
Const COLOR_BTNTEXT = 18 'Button text 
Public
Const COLOR_INACTIVECAPTIONTEXT = 19 'Text of inactive window 
Public
Const COLOR_BTNHIGHLIGHT = 20 '3D highlight of button 
 
To change the colour of the
title bar, or caption, of an active window, you would call the function
in this way:
t& = SetSysColors(1,
COLOR_ACTIVECAPTION, RGB(255,0,0)) 
This example would turn
the active caption red.
