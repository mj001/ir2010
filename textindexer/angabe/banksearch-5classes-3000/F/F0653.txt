C# Code
*** My First C# Project My First C# project is an attempt to write a chess playing machine. I have started writing several classes:
Here is the class for a Chess Board:
// The Board Class is an array of 8 x 8 squares.
// Ideally the Squares in this class should be a member of the Board 
class Board
{
 public void CreateSquares()
 {
 Square[,] squares = new Square[8,8];
 //Now that the array of squares has been created we need to
 //initialise them. Each square has a row, or rank indicated
 //by a number, and a file or column - indicated by a letter
 //on the chess board columns go a-h left to right and rows
 //go 1 to 8 bottom to top (both from the White Perpsective)
 //It is important to be consistent as to dimensions on this
 //array and we will (arbitrarily) assign the 1st dimension to
 //the letters (or columns) and the 2nd to the numbers (or rows)
 //The first square is black, the rest alternate from this one.
