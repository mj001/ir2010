 Advanced Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Chapter 1
The test we do internally at TMS to determine whether we’re running in the IDE involves a routine called InDesign. Here’s the code (the explanation follows):
Public Function InDesign() As Boolean
 ' ****************************************
 ' The only thing Debug.Assert is good for!
 ' ****************************************
 Static nCallCount As Integer
 Static bRet As Boolean ' By default this is set to False.
 nCallCount = nCallCount + 1
 Select Case nCallCount
 Case 1: ' First time in
 Debug.Assert InDesign()
 Case 2: ' Second time in so we must have executed Debug.Assert...
 bRet = True
 End Select
 ' If Debug.Assert called, we need to return True to prevent the trap.
 InDesign = bRet
 ' Reset for future calls.
 nCallCount = 0
End Function
In the earlier versions of Visual Basic (previous to Visual Basic 6), InDesign used API calls to determine whether the Visual Basic IDE was kicking around. The version of InDesign (not shown here) in the first edition of our book evolved from some Visual Basic 4 code and therefore needed to cater to both the 16-bit and 32-bit worlds. We modified this code for the pure 32-bit world and replaced it with what amounts to a call to GetModuleHandle:
Private Function InDesign() As Boolean
 InDesign = 0 "mail" border=0>
