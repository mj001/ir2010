Win Registry
The Windows System Registry is a database where programs save information. You can view the registry by running 'Regedit' in 'Run.' There are several VB functions that enable us to use the registry for our programs.
SaveSetting Function
The SaveSetting function is used to save something to the registry, such as passwords, application values and such...
SaveSetting (AppName, Section, Key, SaveSetting)
 AppName - Is your app's name
 Section - Is the section where the key will be stored
 Key - Used to describe what is being saved
 SaveSetting - The thing you want to save
Example:
 SaveSetting "MyProject", "Main", "Width", frmMain.Width
GetSetting Function
The GetSetting function is used to retrieve saved info from the registry.
GetSetting (AppName, Section, Key)
 AppName - Is your app's name
 Section - Is the section where the key is located
 Key - Used to describe what is being retrieved
Example:
 Private Sub Form_Load()
 Dim X
 X = GetSetting ("MyProject", "Main", "Width")
 frmMain.Width = X 'Refresh width
 End Sub
GetAllSettings Function
The GetAllSettings function is used to find out what's been saved to the reg by a certain program.
GetAllSettings (AppName, Section)
 AppName - Is your app's name
 Section - Is the section where the keys are located
Example:
Dim AllMySettings, i%, Vals
 AllMySettings = GetAllSettings ("MyProject", "Main")
 For i = LBound(AllMySettings) To UBound(AllMySettings)
 Vals = AllMySettings(i, 0) & " " & AllMySettings(i, 1)
 List1.AddItem Vals
 Next i
DeleteSetting Function
The DeleteSetting function is used to delete registry entries.
DeleteSetting (AppName, Section, Key)
 AppName - Is your app's name
 Section - Is the section where the key is located
 Key - Used to describe what is being deleted

 DeleteSetting "MyProject", "Main", "Width"
Save/Get Reg example
Now you know all the built-in Registry functions that VB has, allowing you to save, retrieve, and even delete values form the registry. Knowing this is a big ass plus when it comes to making good apps.
