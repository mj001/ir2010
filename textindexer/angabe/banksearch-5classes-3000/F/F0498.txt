	Product Review:
	
The Ultimate Baker's Dozen
 Normally when I hear about a component's publishers releasing a suite of tools, it always reminds me of those carnival barkers that try to sell you a kitchen tool that slices, dices, smashed, dashes, and does your windows too. They normally end up packaging one or two interesting components with loads of tools that you would never buy on your own. ComponentOne went totally in the opposite direction n they packaged all 13 of their award winning ActiveX components for one low price. They even go further by adding to this mix a subscription service, through which you receive quarterly updates for a full year. These updates contain all the betas, updates, and upgrades of the existing products, plus any new ActiveX components they release during that period. How's that for a revolutionary idea? 
To Grid or Not to Grid!
 Two of ComponentOne Studio's flagship products are True DBGrid Pro, one of the most powerful grid controls in the market; and VSFlexGrid Pro, a turbocharged version on the MSFlexGrid control that comes packaged with Visual Basic. Whatever you need to do in data presentation or input, using a grid format, your bases are covered. 
Data Output and Reporting Tools
 We all need to present our data to the user of our applications in a manner that makes it both intelligible and easy to use. VSVIEW Classic Edition lets you design, create and format complex documents combining text and graphics in an easy, intuitive way; you can then preview them on screen and print them, as well as easily export those documents to HTML or RTF formats. VSVIEW Reporting Edition adds to that already powerful tool, MS Access-style database reporting. You can create powerful database reports, and use all the powers of VSVIEW to format, display, and print them. To let your users customize those report you can use ComponentOne Query, an end-user ad hoc query builder. To top this off, if you need to output charts and graphs you have ComponentOne Chart and WebChart as part of this astounding suite. 
Even the Kitchen Sink!
 For end-user data input, you have True DataControl, a data control on steroids that has built-in application logic, as well as True DBInput Pro and True DBList Pro to help your users get that data in your application in the easiest way possible. SizerOne, formally known as VS-OCX, includes a powerful tab control, a resizing control, and an Awk-like string parsing control. Add to that already powerful mix VSFORUM, a customizable Internet forum tool, and VSSPELL, an international spell-checking and thesaurus control. Through this astounding suite of tools, you can do just about anything you wish to do in ActiveX programming today, plus you're covered for tomorrow. 
- Thirteen powerful ActiveX and server side components 
- One-year subscription covers quarterly updates, upgrades, betas, and new releases fora year 
- All new ActiveX products released are included in the subscription
