 DriveScan: Fast
 recursive file search and folder info example
 
 This VB32 example demonstrates the use of FindFirstFile() in a recursive procedure and
 shows how it can fly through drives and folders. It delivers speed close to that of Find
 in the Start Menu.
 
 The source code shows how to search all available drives for files based on a filename
 and/or wildcard, and how to obtain a total count of folders and files in a specified path.
 Many subtle speed enhancements are employed. Explanatory comments are liberally sprinkled
 throughout.
