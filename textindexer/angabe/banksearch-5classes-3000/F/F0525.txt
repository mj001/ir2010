	Product Review:
	
Look Smarter
 We have all used the charting control that comes with Visual Basic. It's a good control that has provided basic charting for several applications that I have written. But, sometimes you need more. When that happens, TeeChart Pro is a great place to look. The depth of this product is awesome, with hundreds of graph styles in 2D and 3D. I have found graphs that make me look smarter than I really am! Now when that guy with all those initials after his name asks if you can make a polar chart, you can just smile and ask if he would like it in 2D or 3D! 
Don't Work Harder
 TeeChart Pro makes it easy, with the ability to link the control directly to an ADO data source. Or, the ability to export you chart as a Bitmap, metafile, JPEG, PNG and more! And if you develop with ASP, the control allows you to "stream to browser" export. Not sure how to do something? Just look at the over 28 example projects for VB6! That does not count the ASP examples or the examples from the other ten languages. It's easy to use, and they show you how. 
- Data aware, with direct access to ADO data sources 
- 24 Statistical functions 
- 2D, 3D plus OpenGL 3D 
- Image export as bitmap, metafile, JPEG, PNG, GIF, PCX & native Chart format 
- Data export as Excel, XML, HTML, CSV (Text) & native Chart format
