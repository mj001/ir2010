How do ISAs work: 
There are three different types of ISA available and they're outlined below:
Maxi ISAs offer a stocks and shares component and can offer a cash component and a life assurance component* all from a single provider. If you choose to invest in a Maxi ISA you cannot also invest in a Mini ISA (see below) in the same tax year.
Mini ISAs offer all of the components offered by a Maxi ISA - individually. These may come from different providers or from the same provider. 
TESSA only ISAs are the ideal choice when you want somewhere to invest the capital from your maturing TESSA. Your annual ISA subscription limit will not be affected when you do this.
The subscription limits for ISAs are as follows:
Maxi ISAs 
Mini ISAs 
2001-2002 Tax Year 
2001-2002 Tax Year 
Maximum overall subscription level £7,000 
 
- Up to £7,000 stocks & shares (less any contribution to cash and life assurance components. 
- Up to £3,000 stocks & shares 
- Up to £3,000 cash 
- Up to £3,000 cash 
- Up to £1,000 life assurance* 
- Up to £1,000 life assurance* 
 
*Standard Life does not offer the life assurance component of an ISA.

How many ISAs can I have in each tax year?
There are 3 types of ISA: Mini, Maxi and TESSA only. You can't open a Maxi and a Mini ISA in the same tax year. You can have a TESSA only ISA as well as either a Maxi or a Mini. Once you have invested in your choice of ISA you can't change it until the next tax year.

How much can I invest?
The subscription limits for ISAs are as follows:
Maxi ISAs 
Mini ISAs 
2001-2002 Tax Year 
2001-2002 Tax Year 
Maximum overall subscription level £7,000 
 
- Up to £7,000 stocks & shares (less any contribution to cash and life assurance components. 
- Up to £3,000 stocks & shares 
- Up to £3,000 cash 
- Up to £3,000 cash 
- Up to £1,000 life assurance* 
- Up to £1,000 life assurance* 
 
*Standard Life does not offer the life assurance component of an ISA.
You can open a Standard Life Bank Mini Cash ISA with as little as £1 and you can choose to have your ISA either as a Direct Access Savings Account or a 50 Day Notice Account or even a combination of both (as long as your total subscription does not exceed £3,000). You can make further deposits during the tax year up to the maximum level. 
For TESSA only ISAs you can invest up to a limit of £9,000 and this must come from the capital element of a maturing TESSA. You cannot invest any of the interest from your original TESSA investment.

What rates of interest do I earn? 
The rate of interest that you earn on your ISA depends on whether it is a Direct Access Savings Account or 50 Day Notice Account. You will earn the rate applicable to the total amount of funds in that type of account within your plan. Your ISAs can be pooled with other accounts in your plan to earn a potentially higher rate of interest. You can only pool the same types of accounts, for example, ISA Direct Access Savings Accounts can be pooled with other ISA Direct Access Savings Accounts and also ordinary Direct Access Savings Accounts within the plan. Your ISA interest will be paid tax free, however you will be taxed (if you are a taxpayer) on your other accounts.

When can I invest my original TESSA investment?
You must invest your original TESSA money into a TESSA only ISA within six months of it maturing. You don't have to invest it all at once but the total you want to invest must be invested within six months of maturity. We will need to see the original TESSA maturity certificate before we can deposit any money for you.

How long do I have to keep my money in an ISA
You can withdraw the cash component of a Mini or Maxi ISA at any time - just give us a call. But please note if you do remove cash you won't be making the most of your tax-free opportunity and you won't be able to replace the money you have withdrawn. For our ISA 50 Day Notice Account, please remember that if you don't give us 50 clear days' notice of withdrawal, a penalty will be charged to your account equal to 50 days' gross interest on the amount withdrawn.
In addition, you can withdraw funds from your TESSA only ISA at any time, but once the funds have been withdrawn, they cannot be replaced. If you have a TESSA only ISA 50 Day Notice Account, please remember that if you don't give us 50 clear days' notice of withdrawal, a penalty will be charged to your account equal to 50 days' gross interest on the amount withdrawn.
If you wish to make deposits or withdrawals, just telephone us on 08457 555657 Monday to Friday 8am-10pm or on Saturday 8am to 5pm.
If you are choosing to invest in an ISA, you should also note that ISAs should be viewed as a longer term investment. While having access to funds will be important to many people, you should remember that there is a limit on the amount you can deposit in your ISA in any tax year. This means that any money you withdraw cannot be replaced.

How is interest on my ISA calculated?
Interest is calculated daily. We will inform you in writing of any interest rate changes (rates are variable). You can choose to have the interest applied to the account either on a monthly or an annual basis.

How much tax relief will I get?
This depends on your individual financial circumstances. Relief from Income Tax on the interest you will receive is determined by the Inland Revenue.

Does the cash component of Standard Life Bank's ISA conform with Government CAT standards?
A CAT standard is a standard set by the Government to help you identify simple products which offer a fair deal. CAT stands for Charges, Accessibility and Terms. Our ISA Direct Access Savings Account actually exceeds the CAT standards with a minimum investment of £1 (rather than £10). However, because of the 50 day notice period, our ISA 50 Day Notice Account does not conform to the Charge section of the CAT standards. That aside, it does offer a better rate of interest.

What if I change my mind after opening my account?
You can change your mind but you must contact us within 14 days from the day we receive your initial deposit. Cancelling your Mini Cash ISA will automatically result in the cancellation of your ISA account. You can also cancel the cash component of your Maxi ISA within the 14 day cooling off period. In this case, additional funds will then be available for you to use within your stocks and shares component.

Who do I make my deposits payable to?
All deposits should be made payable to Standard Life Bank Ltd. Unfortunately, Standard Life Savings Ltd cannot accept deposits directly. Standard Life Savings is our ISA Manager. We will also accept cheques that have been made payable to the account holder from a third party.

Can I transfer between ISA Managers?
Yes. You can transfer free of charge and without loss of tax status. Just ask your new ISA Manager to contact us. We would also ask that you contact us to authorise the release of your funds to the new provider. You can't switch investments made in the current tax year from a Maxi ISA to a Mini ISA or vice versa.
Back to top    
 
Can I switch my cash ISA to another account?
Yes. You can transfer between the ISA Direct Access Savings Account and the ISA 50 Day Notice Account. But you can't switch from a stocks and shares component to a cash component, or vice versa.

How do I open an account?
- Telephone
Opening an account is remarkably quick and simple. Just ring us on 08457 555657 Monday to Friday 8am-10pm or on Saturday 8am-5pm. 
Please have the following details to hand: 
- The account number and sort code of your UK current bank account or building society account. This will be your designated external account.
- Name, address, date of birth and your National Insurance Number.
- Details of how much you want to deposit with Standard Life Bank - you can open the account with only £1 
- Where and how often interest should be paid 
- Frequency of statements required - monthly, half-yearly or yearly. 
Once we have taken your details we will send you out a Welcome Pack which contains Terms & Conditions and a Direct Debit Mandate.
We'll ask to see two forms of identity. For security reasons we ask you to choose a PIN number and a password. Any time you want to make a transaction, we'll ask you to tell us a random number from your PIN and a character from your password. That's as complicated as it gets.
Please note you cannot open an ISA account online and cannot make online transactions on your ISA.
