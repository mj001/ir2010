International Bank Account Number (IBAN)
 
 
	
	 
	 
	
Introduced to standardise the identification of bank accounts, the IBAN is not a new account number. With the addition of further characters to your existing account number the aim is to improve the quality of information exchanged during European cross-border payments to reduce errors and delays.
An IBAN will only be required when invoices are sent between trading partners in Europe. When an invoice is received containing an IBAN this should be quoted in the account number field on the payment instruction to your bank. Should the word IBAN preface the number this should not be quoted on the payment instruction.

An IBAN consists of a country code, for the United Kingdom that code is GB, a check number calculated by the financial institution issuing the IBAN using an agreed formula that can confirm the validity of the IBAN and an issuing Bank code ('CPBK' in the case of The Co-operative Bank). This is followed by your usual sort code and account number.

You can perform your own integrity check on an IBAN that has been quoted to you by visiting the Associaton for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) website. This check does not validate the existence of the account merely that the IBAN is correctly configured. To perform an integrity check please click here
