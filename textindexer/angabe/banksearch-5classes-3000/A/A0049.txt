	loan protection
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	To take out loan protection you must be a UK resident aged 18 or over and when your loan is finished, under 75. The total value of insured loans you have with Lloyds TSB must be for no more than £25,000. What is covered? 
Your personal circumstances at the time of a claim determine the benefits you are entitled to. 
If you are 18-65 and work for 16 hours or more a week (and have been working for at least 6 months), we will pay your monthly repayments for you if you are away from work for 15 days or more due to illness, accident or involuntary unemployment. 
 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	If you are 18-65 and work part time for less than 16 hours a week or choose not to work (see policy booklet for more details), we will pay your monthly repayments for you if you are incapacitated for 15 days or more due to illness or accident. 
If you have retired or are over 65, we will pay your monthly repayments for you if you need to stay in hospital for more than 5 days. 
Free Positive Job Solutions employment advice service, free health advice line and Accidental permanent total disablement cash benefit of up to £5,000 are included for the policyholder. 
 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	Life cover (including additional cancer benefit) for your loan is also provided for all policyholders. 
Illness or accident claims are paid until your loan ends or until you return to work or are no longer incapacitated, whichever is sooner. 
Unemployment and hospitalisation claims are paid for a maximum of 12 months.
 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	With loans that have a repayment holiday, benefit will not be paid until the first repayment under your deferred loan is due. This does not apply for life cover that protects your loan from the date you sign the loan agreement. 
We will not make payments for disability, cancer benefit or hospitalisation resulting from, a condition for which medical treatment or advice was received in the 12 months before your cover commenced and which recurs in the first 12 months after you take out your loan, any chronic or continuing disease which you had on the start date, normal pregnancy conditions, wilful or self inflicted injuries, drug or alcohol misuse, cosmetic surgery, war and similar risks. 
 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	We will not make payments for unemployment, until you have been working for 16 hours a week or more for at least 6 months, which begins (or you are notified of) within 30 days of the start date of this policy, which was impending when you took out this cover, which follows a period of casual, temporary, voluntary or seasonal work, which results from your misconduct or resignation, which was voluntary or which results from voluntary redundancy, which results from the end of a fixed-term contract for a specific task or a period of training/probation or apprenticeship EXCEPT where you have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least two years on a fixed-term contract and the contract has been previously renewed. 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	The period of insurance for loan protection is linked to the term of your loan. Cover forms part of your loan agreement and cannot be cancelled without terminating the loan. The insurance takes effect from the date that funds are deposited into your account. In the case of deferred loans, benefit will not be paid for claims made prior to the first repayment. This, however, does not apply to the life cover which protects you from the date you sign your loan agreement There is a choice of law applicable to this insurance, but unless agreed otherwise English law applies. 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	For customers who are over 65 or who are retired, repayments will be made for you if you have to stay in hospital for 5 days or more. You have the option of paying the loan protection premium by cash or taking additional credit. If credit is taken to fund the loan protection premium, the conditions and rate of interest for the credit will be as for the cash loan. Loan protection is a single premium fixed term policy which provides cover for the agreed term of the loan. If you have opted to take loan protection and you pay off your loan early you may be entitled to a refund of some of the premium. Any refund will be calculated not on a pro rata basis but using a formula which takes account of the way the risk changes over the term of the loan (please refer to your policy booklet).

	online overdrafts
Overdrafts are repayable in full on demand by the Bank. You may be required to give security for an overdraft. 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	These conditions apply to your Lloyds TSB overdraft, and should be read along with the confirmation letter which we will send you. These conditions are in addition to: 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	conditions which are implied or included in the banking arrangements between us by law, even though they do not appear here or in the confirmation letter; 
and our online Banking and Lloydstsb.com site conditions.
 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	Definitions:
You/your - the customer who has applied for this overdraft and any joint account holder for the account on which the overdraft is to be arranged. 
We/us/our - Lloyds TSB Bank plc or Lloyds TSB Scotland plc, whichever you hold your current account with. 
Overdraft - the overdraft you have arranged through Lloyds TSB Online Banking. 
The confirmation letter - the letter we will send you with details of the overdraft limit, interest and charges. 
 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	Joint Accounts:
If the overdraft is on a joint account, please remember that we can act upon instructions (by telephone, Internet other electronic means or in writing) given by any one of the joint account holders in relation to the account, including the overdraft. This means for example that one party to a joint account could withdraw the entire amount of the overdraft or increase or change the terms of the overdraft. In the event of any such increase or change to the terms of the overdraft we would write to you confirming the position. 
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	General:
The confirmation letter will advise an expiry date for the overdraft. However, you should note that we can contact you (or any/either of you, in the case of joint accounts) at any time and require you to repay all or part of your overdraft immediately. 
It is a condition of your overdraft that regular payments are made into your account, such as a monthly salary. 
You can check your account balance and latest statement entries through our Internet banking service, by using a cash machine or by contacting your branch. 
The confirmation letter will advise the agreed limit on the overdraft. Note that there will be additional interest and charges for exceeding the agreed limit. Full details will be shown in the confirmation letter. 
You will be given at least 14 days’ notice on your statement before charges and interest payments are taken. Once added to your account they will attract interest unless your account is in credit. 
Interest rates and charges can vary. If this happens details will be published in a range of national newspapers and displayed in all of our branches. 
You may terminate the overdraft at any stage by paying into your current account the full outstanding balance on the overdraft plus any outstanding charges and interest relating to the overdraft. 
Your receipt of the confirmation letter will conclude the agreement for your overdraft. In the event of any discrepancy between these conditions and the confirmation letter the terms of the confirmation letter will apply.
