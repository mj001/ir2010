What is a Savings Plan?
A Savings Plan can hold up to 99 different accounts owned by up to six different people. Each individual&#8217;s account details will remain private and secure at all times with each person having their own PIN and password. A Savings Plan can include Direct Access Savings Accounts, 50 Day Notice Accounts and Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs).

What types of Direct Access Savings Accounts are available?
- Single Accounts 
- Joint Accounts where each account holder will have equal access to the account 
- Child Accounts for a person under the age of 16. A Child Account must be opened in the name of an adult who is the account holder. Once the child reaches 16, we can only transfer the Child Account into the name of the former child if the account holder tells us to.

Are there any charges for this account?
There are no charges attached to this account for normal transactions. All deposits and withdrawals are free, and there is no limit to the number of withdrawals that can be done on an account. In addition, interim statements can be requested at any time for no extra charge.

How secure is my money?
Your account is easy to access and yet incredibly secure. When you open an account we will ask you to choose a Personal Identification Number (PIN) and password for access to your accounts on the telephone. It's important to remember that you should not divulge your PIN and password to anyone. 
When you ring us to transact on your account you will be asked for a random number from your PIN and a character from your password. 
If you wish to transact on your accounts via the internet, you can register and we will send you a UserId and temporary internet password in the post. 
If you transact online, you have the reassurance that we use the latest security technology - you will be asked for your UserId and internet password when you log on. The first time you logon, you can change your temporary internet password to a permanent one of your choice. Remember, it is important not to divulge your UserId or internet password to anyone, not even our staff. And in case you forget to log off, the system will automatically log off for you if you haven't used your mouse or keypad after a few minutes.
As with all Standard Life Bank products, our security functions have been stringently tested. Data is scrambled to ensure privacy and we use 128 bit SSL encryption to securely encode and decode the data flowing between your PC and our server.

How do I make deposits and withdrawals with my Standard Life Bank account?
When you open your Direct Access Savings Account you will be asked to provide details of your existing bank or building society account. This account will be used for all transactions to and from your Standard Life Bank account and is referred to as your designated external account. 
It's simple to withdraw or deposit money. You have two options: 
- Online Banking
 
To make withdrawals or deposits over the Internet, just 
 with us for our Online Banking facilities. Once you have registered online we will send you your UserId and internet password by post. 
	
Alternatively, call us on 0845 609 0256 to register. You can use your UserId and internet password to carry out transactions on your accounts during our online banking hours (Monday to Friday 7am-11pm, Saturday 8am-8pm and Sunday 12pm-8pm). 
- Telephone banking
Just ring us Monday to Friday 8am-8pm or Saturday 8am-5pm. You will be asked for a random number from your PIN and a character from your password. Money can be transferred easily from your designated external account into your Standard Life Bank account. If you wish, you can make regular payments into your Direct Access Savings Account by Direct Debit. 
When you're withdrawing money from your Direct Access Savings Account, it will be paid into your designated external account. The process will normally take 3 working days but you will receive interest right up until the money is in your designated external account.

What is pooling?
Pooling allows you to link together more than one account within a Savings Plan (either on your own or with up to five members of family and friends) to take extra advantage of our interest rates. Interest is paid on each individual account at the rate which applies to the total balance of all the accounts held in the Savings Plan. As many as 99 accounts can be pooled within a Plan with up to five other people. In addition, you can have five children named in your Plan.
For example, six people agree that they will pool together in the same Plan. Each deposits £2,000 into a Direct Access Savings Account. Despite the fact that individually they only have £2,000 in their accounts, they will all get paid interest at the rate which applies to the £12,000 tier. 
Importantly each account remains completely private. Each account holder still has their own PIN and password and receives their own separate statements, but simply by pooling together everybody in the Plan benefits from a higher rate of interest. 
If you want to add another person to your existing plan, you will need to call us so that we can take you through your security. You will then need to give us all the details of the new person to be added. This is the only time you will talk on their behalf, they will be sent their own security once their own new account is set up.
Please note however, that you can only pool accounts with the same notice period - you can&#8217;t pool 50 Day Notice Accounts with Direct Access Savings Accounts.

How and when is interest paid?
Interest can be paid monthly or yearly by either: 
- adding it to your account 
- transferring it to another account in your Plan 
- transferring it to your designated external account.
For personal savings, all the interest will be paid net for UK tax-payers except for ISA accounts where interest is paid gross. If you are exempt from tax we will send you the necessary documentation to complete and all your interest will be paid gross. 
If you already hold a Standard Life Bank account and have registered with us to use Online Banking facilities, then you can browse through your account during online banking hours (Monday to Friday 7am-11pm, Saturday 8am-8pm and Sunday 12pm-8pm) and see how much interest you have.

When will I receive statements?
We will normally send you statements on an annual basis but you can request them monthly, quarterly or half yearly. 
If you already hold a Standard Life Bank account and have registered with us to use our Online Banking facilities, then you can view recent transactions on your account at your convenience any time between Monday to Friday 7am-11pm, Saturday 8am-8pm and Sunday 12pm-8pm. If you have access to print facilities you can also print out your statement.

How do I open an account?
- Online
All you have to do is go to our Apply Online section and follow the instructions. Check out our Online Banking Demo to see how easy it is.
Once your account is fully set up and you have returned all of your documentation, you can then register with us for Online Banking facilities. For example, you can make deposits and withdrawals, obtain a balance or browse your recent transactions. Online banking makes banking more convenient for you with our extended internet banking hours of Monday to Friday 7am-11pm, Saturday 8am-8pm and Sunday 12 noon-8pm.
- Telephone
Just ring us on 08457 555657 Monday to Friday 8am-10pm or on Saturday 8am-5pm. 
For both internet and telephone applications, please have the following details to hand: 
- The account number and sort code of your current UK bank account or building society account. This will be your designated external account. 
(NOTE - If you wish to have a joint account with us, you will need to have joint current account details with that person).
- Name, address, date of birth and bank details of all people who are to be added to the Savings Plan.
- Details of how much you want to deposit with Standard Life Bank - you can open the account with only £1. 
- Where and how often interest should be paid. 
- Frequency of statements required - monthly, half-yearly or yearly. 
Once we have taken your details we will send you out a Welcome Pack which contains Terms & Conditions and a Direct Debit Mandate. If you have added other people to your Savings Plan, they will each receive their own Welcome Pack.
We'll ask to see two forms of identity. For security reasons we ask you to choose a PIN number and a password. Any time you want to make a transaction, we'll ask you to tell us a random number from your PIN and a character from your password. That's as complicated as it gets.
