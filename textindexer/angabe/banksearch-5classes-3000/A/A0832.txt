* The rates quoted (correct at 14 March 2002
 and subject to variation) apply as follows for non chequebook accounts:
 4.1% AER for credit balances over £1 but below £50,000, 
 	4.0% AER for credit balances of £50,000 but below £250,000, 
 	3.7% AER for credit balances of £250,000 +.
 	
 
 
 
 
 AER stands for the Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates the interest rate as if paid 
 and compounded annually. Interest is calculated daily, based on the amount in your 
 account at the end of each 
 day (not including any cheques that have yet to clear) and is added to your account 
 each month.
 
** Cash advances from non-LINK machines will
 incur a 1.5% fee (minimum £1.50) and non-sterling advances will
 incur an additional charge of 2.25%. Other charges are listed in our
 terms and conditions.
cahoot accounts are available, subject to status,
 to UK residents who are aged 21 or over and who have regular Internet
 access. Written quotations are available on request from contact.us@cahoot.com.
