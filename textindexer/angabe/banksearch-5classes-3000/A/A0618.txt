General Features of the Euro Coins 
In 1996 the Ministers of Finance decided that the euro
coins would have one common European side and one
national side.
Common European Side
Following a competition, the designs by Mr. Luc Luycx,
of the Royal Belgian Mint, were selected for the common
European side of the coins. These designs feature three
different maps of Europe. In the background there are
12 stars of the European Union.
The denominational values of the coins are 1, 2, 5, 10,
20 and 50 cent, €1 and €2. The eight coin denominations
or values vary in size, weight, material, colour and
thickness which helps to facilitate their recognition
by the blind and partially sighted. In addition, the edge
finishing of the coins is different for each
consecutive denomination.
National Side of the Euro Coins
Each Member State designed the "national" side of its
country's euro coins, depicting familiar national motifs.
A small number of euro coins with national sides will be
minted for, and issued by, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican
City. They will be legal tender throughout the euro area.
It is unlikely that these will go into general circulation
as virtually all of them will become collectors' items.
You can pay with the
Euro coins throughout the Euro area,
irrespective of their national characteristics.
