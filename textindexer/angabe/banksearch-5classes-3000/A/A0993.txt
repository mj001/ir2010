When will my cover commence?
 Once your account is opened and your first salary credit has been received 
 into your account, your cover will automatically commence. (This date 
 will be confirmed on your policy document which will be sent to you). 
 The date this happens will be your commencement date and cover will then 
 last for 12 months.

 above.
