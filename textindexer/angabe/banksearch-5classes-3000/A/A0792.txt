The aggregation feature was very appealing to me, since it 
 laid out my financial statements in different institutions 
 in one place. Although I have current and savings accounts 
 at Citibank, I have never thought of signing up for Citibank 
 Online. After I used My Accounts, it was so convenient in 
 adding financial institutions that it enticed me to sign up 
 for Citibank Internet Banking. Since then, I loved it and 
 I am hooked!

Greatest Site Ever
 
 
My Accounts is a great web site with a 'clean' look, and 
 some of the best functionality on the web. I'm a new user, 
 but I can tell I will be a frequent one, for this site will 
 make life easier. In other words, it does what every other 
 site says it will do.
 
Most importantly, I am a Citibank Cardholder who probably 
 fits on your 'inactive' list. 
 
Now, however, I'm going to activate my Citibank card online 
 and begin using it (rather than my card from a competitor 
 bank). Once again, excellent work.

 I work on a sailboat, and don't have 
 a lot of time to get online. When I do, I love to use My Accounts, 
 because I can see all my online accounts in one place, even 
 if they are not Citibank accounts. 
 
It really helps me save time, and manage all my accounts 
 effectively. I think it's great!
