You'll need to insure the cost of replacing everything in your home as 
 new. 
 
This calculator will help you work out the amount of your contents sum 
 insured. All you have to do is fill in the amount it would cost to buy 
 the same items new today.
 
Some items are more at risk of being stolen than others. We've listed 
 these as high risk items. They have a limit of 1/3 of your contents sum 
 insured in total and £2,000 for a single item. If your high risk items 
 are worth more than this, please tell us so that we can make sure you're 
 covered properly.

personal belongings
 
It might also be a good idea to insure the things that you take away 
 from your home like jewellery, clothing and cameras. 
 
This calculator will help you to work out how much your personal belongings 
 should be insured for. Again, you need to fill in how much it would cost 
 to replace these items as new. If you have other personal belongings you 
 want to cover, just tell us about them and we'll tell you if we can insure 
 them. 
 
These items are not covered unless you list them separately, and we agree 
 to cover them
 
 
Any items worth more than £1500
 Contact lenses
 Camping equipment
 China, glass, pottery, other fragile items
 
 
If you have personal belongings insurance, you don't need to include 
 them in the contents section.
