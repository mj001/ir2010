Buying and selling shares
 
 Investing directly in stocks and shares 
 gives you the potential for good returns. But take care. You're 
 not guaranteed to get back what you invested. 
 
 Our execution-only, certificate-free Internet Sharedealing service 
 allows you to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Buy and sell shares online 
 
 
 
 
 Access share prices 24 hours a day 
 
 
 
 
 Review recent market and company news 
 
 
 
 
 Manage and track your share portfolios 
 
 
 
 
 Create and track 'fantasy' portfolios 
 
 
 
 
 Hold shares in electronic form, in a CREST 
 Personal Member Account 
 
 
 
 
 Transfer existing paper holdings into electronic 
 form 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 To 
 register for this service and apply online click here. 
 
The service enables you to buy and sell shares 
 at home, at work or anywhere in the world with access to the internet 
 via a PC, Mac or laptop (or any device with a web-enabled browser 
 that supports 128-bit encryption). You can place trades, view 
 market information and access your portfolio online 24 hours a 
 day, 7 days a week.* Even if the stock market is closed, you can 
 leave an order for execution the following day. 
 
 No paper certificates are issued and holdings are registered in 
 CREST, the electronic system for the holding and transfer of shares. 
 
 
 Your shares will be held in a CREST Personal Member Account. This 
 means that your name will appear on the company's shareholder 
 register and you will receive reports and accounts, dividends, 
 shareholder perks and details of corporate actions such as rights 
 issues, directly from company registrars. 
 
 The free information service is available to everyone. Registration 
 is simple and can be done online. To use the online trading service 
 you will need a UK mainland HSBC current account, and must be 
 resident in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man. For 
 further information on how to apply click here. 
 
 Internet Sharedealing customers can also place orders by phone 
 and talk to us about analysts' opinions of researched companies. 
 
 
 An alternative to Internet Sharedealing is Teletrade Plus, our 
 telephone-based certificate-free sharedealing facility for private 
 investors. It allows HSBC Bank mainland current account holders 
 to trade and access market information directly over the telephone, 
 with the option of online access. Members can call our dealing 
 room, Stockbroker Opinions service and Customer Services team, 
 using one local rate number. To register for a personalised application 
 pack, contact 0800 100 250. 
 
 
 Non-HSBC account holders can request a current account application 
 form by clicking on 'Request a Brochure' and selecting our brochure 
 entitled 'Bank Account' from the list. Opening a current account 
 with us also gives you access to our Internet Banking service 
 where you can check your statement, pay your bills and transfer 
 money 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.* 
 
 For further information on other ways of buying and selling shares 
 with HSBC contact your local branch to arrange a meeting with 
 a Financial Planning Manager.
