It's unlike any other Birmingham Midshires branch before it - a better way for you to select the information and get the advice that's right for you.
If you're ever in Liverpool, take a look around our Bold Street branch, which is the first of our branches to receive the new look. You can see from the interactive diagram that we've catered for all the things you might need.
- There's an area where you are free to roam; you can select from our range of literature, find more out about our products and take your time. You can approach our staff and ask them for further help.
- Interview Rooms; make an appointment to speak to one of our Financial Consultants in confidence and get the most from your money.
- There's also the traditional counter, where business can be conducted with one of our cashiers.
Look out for a new-look branch opening near to you soon.
