Northern Bank Annual Results Year to 30 September 2000
Northern Bank today released its annual results and announced pre-tax profits of £92.3M.
Total lending is up 10.4% to £2.8bn compared with the same period last year. Personal loans grew by 7% and mortgages by 10%, while business lending increased by 13% to £1.4bn.
"While profits are slightly down on last year, this has been a year of steady growth for Northern. Non-Interest Income shows a healthy increase of 6% reflecting increased business activity across a wide range of the bank's services. The slight decline in Net Interest Income highlights the increasingly competitive market in which we operate," said Don Price, Chief Executive, Northern Bank.
The 8% fall in profits is largely attributable to the following factors. The Bank's cost base has increased significantly over 1999 following a major realignment of the National Australia Bank Group operations in Europe during the year. This realignment has resulted in a greater proportion of the Group's costs being consolidated directly into the results of the Northern Bank. Specific bad debt charges were £1.2 million higher than in 1999 when the Bank also benefited from a one off release of £3.8 million restructuring provisions created in earlier years.
This year, Northern opened a new branch at Victoria Street in Belfast and three new business centres in Enniskillen, Lisburn and Coleraine. We also introduced a new dedicated Executive Banking service for high net worth customers. The service has been welcomed by customers and the number of Executive Banking managers has been increased by over 50% to meet this demand.
"The strategy of segmenting our customer base and introducing products which meet the needs of the market is clearly paying dividends and we will continue to follow through this direction while listening to our customers," said Mr Price.
Northern marked the Millennium celebrations with the introduction of western Europe's first plastic £5 note. The note lasts up to 4 times longer than a regular paper note and has become a collector's item in the UK.
The introduction of the NSPCC Charity Bond and the Guaranteed Equity Bond were very successful, demonstrating an active market for innovative deposit products. The Charity Bond raised £20,000 for the NSPCC.
Our Community Investment programme was repositioned this year to include staff involvement and funding. This has resulted in several successful partnerships, including Cinemagic, Maths 2000, Young Enterprise and the Ulster Museum.
