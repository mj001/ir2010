 In the event of the worst imaginable 
 becoming a reality, the SELF ASSURANCE Term Personal service 
 can help you with your financial commitments… simple things 
 you may not consider such as everyday living expenses.
 
 The benefit takes the form of a death or critical illness benefit, 
 paying out when you are diagnosed with a critical illness, or 
 when you die - whichever happens first. Your premiums will also 
 be automatically paid if you are unable to work due to sickness, 
 accident, or disability.
 
 The benefit comes as a pay out increasing over time to cover 
 you against inflation.
