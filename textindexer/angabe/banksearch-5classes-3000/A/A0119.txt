Welcome to Stakeholder Pensions for Self-employed 
 people 
 
What pension options 
 do I have? 
 You have several options available to you if you want to start 
 a pension for yourself. These include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Personal 
 pension plan 
 A personal 
 pension plan lets you set aside money on either a regular 
 or one-off basis. All contributions you make are paid net of basic 
 rate income 
 tax. If you are a higher rate taxpayer you can claim 
 additional tax relief from your local tax office. The money is invested 
 in the pension fund and grows in a tax efficient environment. On 
 reaching retirement, you can normally take part of the fund (up 
 to 25%) as a tax-free lump sum. The remainder is then used to provide 
 an income, which will be subject to income 
 tax. You can usually have access to your pension fund 
 from the age of 50. You must take the benefits by your 75th birthday. 
 
 
In order to take out a personal pension plan you must: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Be resident and be ordinarily 
 resident in the UK 
 
- Have a National Insurance number 
 
 
 
 
 You can pay in up to £3,600 gross 
 per year, regardless of your earnings. It may be possible to pay more. 
 This depends on your age and earnings, as indicated in the table below. 
 If you do want to pay more than £3,600 gross 
 per year we will require proof of your earnings. This can be in the 
 form of a letter from your accountant, a copy of your accounts or 
 a copy of your tax self-assessment returns.

Self-invested personal pension 
 (SIPPS) 
 This is similar to a personal 
 pension plan. The main differences are that the associated 
 charges with a SIPP 
 may be higher. The minimum investment in a SIPP 
 is usually higher and a SIPP offers 
 greater investment freedom. For example, it is possible to buy individual 
 stocks and shares. 
 
If you would like to find out more information about 
 personal 
 pension plans and self- 
 invested personal pensions, please contact an HSBC Bank 
 branch and speak to the Financial 
 Planning Manager who will be able to help you. Click 
 here to find your nearest branch. Please 
 note these products may incur higher charges than a Stakeholder 
 Pension. 
 
Stakeholder Pension 
 
 This is similar to a personal 
 pension plan except it has to meet certain strict government 
 standards, which are intended to benefit you. These are: 
 
 
 
 
 
- The only charge you will pay is an annual 
 management charge. 
 
- The maximum annual 
 management charge will be 1% of the pension fund 
 each year. 
 
- Contributions from as little as £20 gross 
 can be made, whether this is a regular or single premium. 
 
 
- You will be able to stop and start contributions 
 whenever it suits you without charge. 
 
- You will be able to transfer your pension 
 fund without charge. 
 
- Employees who are members of occupational 
 pension schemes can contribute up to £3,600 gross 
 per year into a Stakeholder Pension 
 provided they earn less than £30,000 per year. Controlling 
 directors and individuals earning more than £30,000 
 per year cannot. 
 
- Contributions to a Stakeholder Pension can 
 be made by variable Direct Debit. 
 
 
- You can pay into a Stakeholder Pension 
 for your children and spouse. There is no minimum age or 
 earnings level for someone to start a Stakeholder Pension. 
 In effect you could pay up to £3,600 gross 
 each year into a Stakeholder Pension for someone until their 
 75th birthday. If they are a member of an occupational 
 pension scheme earning more than £30,000 per 
 year or are a controlling 
 director they will not be eligible for a Stakeholder 
 Pension. If you wish to apply for a Stakeholder Pension 
 for someone over the age of 18, you can do this via our 
 website. However, you will need to complete a paper Direct 
 Debit, which we will send to you. If you wish to set up 
 a Stakeholder Pension for someone below the age of 18 you 
 will need to contact one of our Financial 
 Planning Managers at an HSBC Bank branch. Click 
 here to go to our branch directory. 
 
 
 
 
 If you are interested in Stakeholder Pensions, 
 you have the following options: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- If you are unsure whether you should take 
 out a Stakeholder Pension the 
 Decision Trees may help you make an informed decision. 
 These have been designed to help you decide whether a Stakeholder 
 Pension is the right product to suit your personal retirement 
 planning needs. 
 
- You can create an estimate of potential 
 benefits from a Stakeholder Pension, based on the contributions 
 you would make, your age and other factors, using our pension 
 calculator. 
 
 
 
 
 If you have already used the Decision 
 Trees, and are familiar with what a Stakeholder Pension could offer 
 you, you can apply for a Stakeholder Pension with HSBC by clicking

 Reasons for introduction 
 The Government announced its intention to reform 
 pensions from April 2001. A full copy of the Government's document 
 (published on 25 May 2000) can be viewed by visiting the Department 
 of Social Security website, www.dss.gov.uk. 
 This document outlines the key proposals to change the face of pensions. 
 
 
A new simple, flexible and low cost pension will be 
 introduced known as a Stakeholder Pension. The low charges and product 
 simplicity should make retirement planning more attractive and easier 
 for many people. Individuals will normally be able to take the pension 
 benefits built up from a Stakeholder Pension in addition to the 
 State pension and other pension benefits. 
 
 
Regulation
 
 
 
 
 
 
- The Occupational 
 Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) will regulate 
 the operation of all schemes and maintain a register of 
 them. Employers responsible for offering a Stakeholder Pension 
 will also need to ensure the Stakeholder Pension they have 
 designated for their employees is continually registered 
 with OPRA. 
 
- The Financial Services 
 Authority (FSA) will regulate the marketing of schemes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 What if I have other pension 
 benefits? 
 You may already have one or more existing pensions. These may be from 
 previous employers or pensions you have set up yourself. If you are 
 still paying into one or more of these pensions, this will have an 
 effect on the amount you can pay into a Stakeholder Pension. The maximum 
 amount you can pay, called the contribution 
 limit includes all pensions, not just contributions to one 
 particular pension. You will need to ensure that the total of all 
 pension contributions does not exceed the contribution 
 limits. You may want to seek advice from a Financial 
 Adviser on what options you have. 
 
Transferring Stakeholder Pension 
 benefits 
 One of the benefits of a Stakeholder Pension is that you will be 
 able to move funds from one Stakeholder Pension to another, without 
 additional charge. This gives you complete flexibility to move your 
 existing Stakeholder Pension funds when it suits you. It is possible 
 to move your existing pension arrangements to a new Stakeholder 
 Pension with us. Please note that there 
 may be a charge for advice relating to transfers.
 
If you are considering moving your existing pension 
 arrangements to a Stakeholder Pension with us you will need to contact 
 the Financial Planning Manager at 
 an HSBC Bank branch. Click here 
 to find your nearest branch of HSBC.
