	What is a management buy-out&#63;
	A management buy-out ("MBO") essentially involves the acquisition of a business by its existing management. Normally management will establish a new holding company (a "Newco") together with a financial institution (i.e. an organisation that specialises in investing in unquoted companies, often referred to as a "Venture Capitalist" or a "Private Equity House") which will purchase the shares of the "Target" company which employs such management. Variations of this are a management buy-in ("MBI") where external management buy the business and a buy-in management buy-out ("BIMBO") which is a combination of the two.

	Why should I do it&#63;
	Common reasons given are to make money, gain an opportunity to have more say in your destiny, maintain a lifestyle or simply job preservation. Typical trigger points occur when a strategic decision is taken by a parent company to sell the business, there is a change of control of a family run business (perhaps to family members not involved in running it) and insolvency of the company or its parent. You should have a belief that you can run the business better than the existing shareholders and if you are seeking financial assistance on commercial terms then the only motive likely to attract funding will be that of financial gain&#33;

	What are the characteristics of a successful MBO&#63;
	The key features are a sound business with solid cash flow generation, high growth prospects and an experienced management team.

	What's involved in doing an MBO&#63;
	The first step will be to write a business plan. Aside from being a planning and communication exercise, this will be used to ascertain the value of the business and attract potential funders. Doing an MBO is a specialist activity and the early involvement of experienced advisers is strongly recommended. In view of the very large number of MBO's that Bank of Scotland provides finance for, we are naturally aware of particular industry and geographical strengths of advisers and can introduce you to specialists appropriate to your needs. Such advisers can assist you with your business plan (but will not write it for you), provide advice on bidding tactics and perhaps do the negotiations on your behalf. (The latter can be useful in maintaining good employer/employee relations during the MBO process.) They can also project manage the whole process and negotiate the financing terms.
	An MBO will involve a large number of legal agreements covering the acquisition, warranties, Newco equity terms, management service contracts, bank facilities and other commercial contracts. Again a good adviser will steer you through the whole process. Whilst all of this is going on you still have to run a business and therefore can't afford to take your eye of the ball! It can be stressful and involve long hours but if you are running a successful business then you will probably be used to that&#33;

	What kind of funding will I need&#63;
	An MBO will involve raising equity and debt funding to pay for the acquisition as well as bank facilities for ongoing working capital. Additional finance might also be required for capital expenditure. As creative debt funding will reduce your need to secure more expensive equity capital, the opportunity of maximising this should be looked at first. A glossary of frequently used terms can be found by clicking here.

	Where can I get finance&#63;
	With bank funding representing the largest component in any MBO, it makes sense for you to talk to us first. Our specialist staff in "Structured Finance" can talk you through the whole process in much more detail than contained here, in confidence (even on a no-name basis) and with absolutely no obligation on your part. The British Venture Capital Association is also a good source of information.

	How much money will I have to invest&#63;
	This will depend on both the overall funding requirement and your own personal wealth. Funders want to see that you are committed to the business otherwise if you won't put your money where your mouth is then why should they&#63; In the absence of other readily realisable assets, a common rule of thumb is one year's gross remuneration. Bank of Scotland can assist you with this. Contact us for further details.

	How long does it take&#63;
	This can vary enormously from a few weeks to several years&#33; However, a typical time frame is around 6 months.

	Can I get fired for talking about an MBO&#63;
	In broad terms, as an employee, you have a responsibility not to disclose confidential information or do anything which could otherwise harm the business. Again, professional advice should be sought at an early stage. In some cases, owners may actively encourage management to mount a bid and in others they are specifically prohibited from this so as not to put off prospective trade purchasers who will want the existing management to stay on. Business is all about management and you should not underestimate your power to insist on at least exploring the possibility of a bid.

	If a proposed MBO is unsuccessful, is my job at risk&#63;
	This would depend on whether the business was sold to another party or remained under the control of its existing owners. Clearly a trade purchaser might not wish to retain your services but this might happen regardless of whether you attempted an MBO. Existing owners might question your motivation but providing you have acted properly then this should not be grounds for dismissal. As the saying goes - nothing ventured, nothing gained&#33;

	Will our finance partners have a say in the structure of the management team&#63;
	Financial institutions back people rather than assets and will want to know that there is an experienced balanced team running the business. If there are weaknesses then they will want to see these addressed. As an investor, this is in your interests too. Financial institutions will generally appoint a non-executive chairman and/or a non-executive director to the board of Newco. This might be an executive of the financial institution or someone with experience of the sector involved or with the stage of growth that the business is at.

	What will an MBO mean to me in terms of commitment&#63;
	As a director of a company you will have responsibilities to shareholders and other stakeholders. As an owner of a business your motivation will probably change and you are likely to spend more hours in the business. There is a certain amount of truth in the saying that "it is not only the assets that sweat in an MBO"&#33; It will be a lifestyle change and it is important that you have support from your partner.

	Will it make me rich&#63;
	Doing an MBO will probably be the biggest financial decision of your life - even more than your home. Financial institutions will be looking to at least double their money in 3 years. They will only do this if managers are well incentivised. Whilst the weight of their money will generally be far greater than that of yours, you can expect to gain a much larger multiple on your investment than that of the financial institution concerned.
