1 By Multifunction Card holders from banks, organisations or cash machines displaying the
VISA symbol, but which are not part of the Abbeylink or LINK cash machine networks. 2 By Abbeylink Card holders from cash machines displaying the Cirrus symbol, but which are
not part of the Abbeylink or LINK cash machine networks. 3 Will be charged on a calendar month basis. 4 Applies to any paid transaction resulting in unauthorised overdraft or whilst unauthorised
overdrawn. 5 Only available to customers aged 18 or over, subject to status. Written quotations are
available on request. We have the right at any time to require repayment of an overdrawn
balance on your account, whether the balance is above or below the limit of any authorised
overdraft. Provided you have not exceeded your overdraft limit, we shall whenever possible
give you at least 28 days' notice in writing. However, it may be necessary for our
protection to require earlier repayment, in which case we shall give as much notice as is
practical in the circumstances. We may vary the overdraft interest rates by advertising
the variation in at least 3 national daily newspapers and displaying notices in our
branches. 6 Cash withdrawals made outside the United Kingdom are subject to this charge in addition to
the VISA/PLUS cash withdrawal handling charge. 7 Per calendar year. 8 AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if
interest was paid and added each year. The gross rate of interest is the rate of interest
payable before the deduction of income tax. You may be able to receive interest gross,
otherwise interest will be paid net of income tax at the prescribed rate. We may vary
charges or introduce new charges by giving you at least 30 days' notice. We ask that you
mandate at least £250 per month into your Abbey National Bank Account. Please note
an unauthorised overdraft fee and interest may be incurred solely as a result of charges
being debited in the previous month. This tariff is applicable to Abbey National Bank
Account holders. Charges for less frequently used services can be provided on request.
Interest rates may vary and are correct at time of going to press.
