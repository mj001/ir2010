 Sponsorships 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ulster Orchestra
 
Bank of Ireland has been sponsoring the Ulster Orchestra for almost a decade. The sponsorship takes the form of the New Year Viennese Concert, which is regarded as one of Northern Ireland's most prestigious social and cultural events. As a result, this sponsorship has become an important one in the Bank’s corporate entertainment calendar.
 
 Through our sponsorship of the Orchestra we have won an award from Arts and Business, under the Pairing Scheme, and for the past three years have been given the rights to an extra concert, which this season took the form of the ‘Words and Music for Christmas’ Concert.
Based in Belfast, the Ulster Orchestra was formed in 1966 and has established itself as one of the major symphony orchestras in the United Kingdom. In addition to the main concert season which runs from October to May each year, the Orchestra is involved in varied home-based activities including participation in the Belfast Festival at Queen's and the Belfast Proms.
