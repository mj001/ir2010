What types of business account are available?
You can choose a Direct Access Savings Account or a 10 Day Notice Account. Both offer competitive tiered interest rates. The 10 Day Notice Account offers higher interest but you must give 10 clear days’ notice before making any withdrawals. Both accounts work alongside your existing bank or building society business account (known as the designated external account).

What is a Savings Plan?
A Savings Plan can hold up to 99 different accounts for the same business and all the accounts are completely separate. This means you can set up different named accounts for different things. A Savings Plan can include Direct Access Savings Accounts as well as 10 Day Notice Accounts.

Are there any charges for this account?
Business accounts do not have any charges attached to them for normal transactions. However, with a 10 Day Notice Account, you will be charged a penalty equal to 10 days notice on the amount withdrawn if you do not give us 10 clear days’ notice of withdrawal. There is no limit to the number of withdrawals that you can request. In addition, interim statements can be requested at any time free of charge.
Charges will be made for Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) transfers, any cheques that are not honoured and failed direct debits.

How secure is the client account?
Your client account is easy to access and yet incredibly secure. There is a minimum of two and a maximum of three authorised persons on all client accounts. These are the only people able to make transactions on the account or make alterations to the way in which it is run. Each authorised person has their own personal identification number (PIN) and password which allows for client to be transacted security between your designated external account and your Standard Life Bank client account
There is also the option to register for our online banking facility. If you transact online, you have the reassurance that we use the latest security technology - you will be asked for your internet User ID and password when you log on. And, just in case you forget to log off, the system will automatically log off for you if you haven't used your mouse or keypad after a few minutes.

How do I make deposits and withdrawals? 
When you open a client account you will be asked to provide details of your existing bank or building society account. This account will be used for all transactions to and from your Standard Life Bank account and is referred to as your designated external account. 
It's simple to deposit or withdraw money: 
- Online Banking 
Once you have opened your Business Savings Plan, you may register for Online Banking. You register via this website or by simply calling us on 0845 609 0257. When you have registered for online banking we will send you your UserId and internet password by post. 
You can use your UserId and internet password to carry out transactions on your accounts during our online banking hours (Monday to Friday 7am-11pm, on Saturday 8am-8pm and Sunday 12pm-8pm). 
There are certain amendments to the business account which can only be made over the telephone, such as a change of authorised person, so it is important that you retain details of your PIN and password even if you generally transact online.
- Telephone banking
Just ring us Monday to Friday 8am-8pm or Saturday 8am-5pm. You will be asked for a random number from your PIN and a character from your password. Money can be transferred easily from your designated external account into your Standard Life Bank account. If you wish, you can make regular payments into your business account by Direct Debit.
All deposits and withdrawals are made to and from your designated external account. Initial deposits can be made by CHAPS, cheque or Bank Giro Credit. 
When you're withdrawing money from your business account, it will be paid into your designated external business account. The process will normally take 3 working days but you will receive interest right up until the money is in your designated external account. Withdrawals made from a 10 Day Notice Account will be subject to 10 days’ notice. If you are unable to give us 10 days’ notice of withdrawal, you will be charged a penalty equal to 10 days’ gross interest on the amount withdrawn which will be deducted from the remaining balance on the account.

What is pooling?
Within your Plan you can have up to 99 accounts. We pay interest on each individual account at the rate which applies to the total balance of all the pooled accounts held in the Plan. As our interest is calculated in tiers, this means you could earn even more. 
You can set up separate named accounts for different needs within a Savings Plan. All the accounts remain completely separate but this facility makes the administration of separate funds easy while potentially giving you access to higher returns. 
You must pool accounts with the same notice period - you can’t pool 10 Day Notice Accounts with Direct Access Savings Accounts.

How and when is interest paid?
Interest is paid to each individual account at the rate which applies to the total Savings Plan balance. Up to 99 accounts can be held within each Savings Plan. Interest can be paid either monthly or yearly. It can be: 
- added to the individual account 
- paid to the designated external account 
Please note, interest is paid NET on client accounts. Tax deduction certificates will be sent for each account every April and on account closure.

When will I receive statements? 
We will normally send you statements on an annual basis but you can request them monthly, quarterly or half yearly. 
If you use our Online Banking service you can browse your account during our Internet banking hours Monday to Friday 7am - 11pm, Saturday 8am - 8pm and Sunday 12 noon - 8pm.

How do I open a client account?
Opening a client account is remarkably quick and simple. All you have to do is ring us on 08457 555659 Monday to Friday 8am - 10pm or on Saturday 8am - 5pm. We will take details and issue a Welcome Pack directly to your client address, for the attention of the first authorised person. A PIN/password letter will be issued to each authorised person at their home address. You then complete the necessary documents in the Welcome Pack and return them to us along with the information requested to confirm the identity of each authorised person. We will also arrange payment of initial deposit, by cheque, Bank Giro Credit or CHAPS. Once all documents have been received and the initial deposit has been received, we will issue an opening balance statement direct to the client. We will send a letter of confirmation when the account is operational and any of the authorised persons can transact on the account. 
 We will need the following personal details: 
- Your name and the name of your business 
- Your agency code (if applicable) 
- Details of authorised person(s) - full name, home address, client telephone number 
- Designated bank/building society name and address, account name, number and sort code 
- Initial deposit/regular deposit amount (if regular, frequency and date) 
- Where and how often interest should be paid
