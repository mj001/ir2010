 Our
deposit accounts are available only to permanent UK residents and for sterling
deposits. The Twelve Month Notice
Account permits a withdrawal of 10% of the balance instantly and without penalty
provided there have been no withdrawals in the previous twelve months. 
Interest can be paid gross in respect of all accounts in appropriate circumstances upon
receipt of the duly completed Inland Revenue form which is available on request.
Hampshire Trust is a member of the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme &#150; for more details
please see below. 
Should you wish to take advantage of an investment into any of these accounts please
read the following notes before submitting your application.
 
 
 
 
 As you may be aware, regulations have now come into force which require all banking institutions to introduce
 procedures for the verification of the identity of their account holders. Therefore we
 would be grateful if you could send your application duly completed and signed together
 with an original of a recent utility bill, local authority tax bill or a bank or building
 society statement as verification of your address. 
We shall also need a telephone number on which we may contact you during
 the working day and this should be included in the form. If the telephone is not currently
 listed in your own name then please provide the name of the person or business in whose
 name it is listed. 
 
May we emphasize that we cannot open an account for you until
 we have received a fully completed application form including your name and permanent
 address, together with the necessary documentation and a cheque drawn on a United Kingdom
 bank or building society. 
 
On opening an account you will receive a folder incorporating
 investment and withdrawal books together with a supply of prepaid envelopes. 
 
 
The experienced team dealing with the management of Hampshire Trust&#146;s
cheque, deposit and savings accounts seek to couple efficiency with friendly service,
which was for so long the tradition of British bankers. The Bank enjoys a very close,
personal relationship with its depositors and savers and all members of the team strive to
provide an individual and personal service.
