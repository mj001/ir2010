 Introduction
 Current accounts help you to manage your day to day finances. You can 
 arrange to have your wages or salary paid directly into your account and 
 regular bills like pension payments and car insurance can be settled 
 straight from the account every month. Monthly statements help you to keep 
 track of your spending too. The Royal Bank can usually supply cheque books 
 as well as Highline cards, so your money is always within easy reach. And 
 most current accounts even pay interest on your money when you're in 
 credit, so you can be saving without even knowing it.
 
 Interest
 Just as we pay interest to you when you deposit your money with us, we 
 charge interest when you borrow from us. Depending on the type of loan, 
 the interest rate can be fixed for the whole period, or it can vary. Flat 
 rate loans allow you to budget more easily because you always know what 
 your repayments are going to be. See the example below:
 
 Loan Protection
 You can protect yourself in case you are unable to make your repayments. 
 You pay a little extra each month so that if you&#146;re made redundant during 
 the period of the loan, or suffer from ill health that stops you working, 
 your loan repayments will be covered until you&#146;re able to work again. Loan 
 protection means you don&#146;t have to worry that your family will be saddled 
 with a debt that they can&#146;t pay. So you can have peace of mind knowing 
 that everything will be taken care of.
 
 Typical working example of a loan
 In the real world, you can use your extra cash to buy almost anything you 
 like. From a new car to a new kitchen, from course fees to short term 
 finance, a loan makes it easier for you to live the lifestyle you want. 
 You can often borrow up to 100% of the purchase price and the repayments 
 can usually be spread over a number of years. The example figures below 
 give you a rough idea of what you might expect to pay.

 Annual 
 Percentage Rate (APR) 
 
 To help 
 you make a meaningful comparison between the different interest rates 
 on offer, all lenders are obliged by law to use a standard method of 
 calculating and displaying 'APR'. APR is an interest rate which takes 
 account of the full amount of interest on any money borrowed plus the 
 timing of repayments and any other charges that you have to pay. The 
 frequency of the interest payments, for example monthly or quarterly, 
 affects the calculation. By way of an example, a loan for £1,500 with 
 an arrangement fee of £15, repayable over 24 months with interest 
 being charged quarterly at 15.5% would give an APR of 17.5%. (All APR 
 figures must be written bold type.) 
 
 
 
 
 Effective Annual Rate (EAR) 
 
 When we 
 let you borrow money by way of an overdraft, the real annual cost of 
 the interest charged may be shown as an annual rate taking account of 
 how often interest is charged. All other charges for the borrowing, 
 for example arrangement fees, have to be listed separately. As an 
 example, if interest is charged at 1.50% per month, this is equivalent 
 to an EAR of 19.56%. 
 
 
 
 
 In-principle 
 
 This is a 
 decision we give providing agreement to the loan subject to additional 
 criteria being met. 
 
 
 
 
 Maximum Advance Premium 
 
 The 
 maximum advance premium (MAP) will be incurred for any mortgage which 
 is in excess of 90% of the purchase price or valuation, if lower. The 
 premium will be charged on the amount of the loan above 75% of the 
 purchase price or valuation, if lower. 
 
 
 
 
 Repayment period 
 
 This is 
 the period that the loan is spread over.
