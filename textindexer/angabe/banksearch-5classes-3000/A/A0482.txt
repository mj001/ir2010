"Invest up to
£21,000* tax free!?!
You'll be telling me
Elvis is alive next"
Trust the specialists to spot some unbelievable talent
It's true! This investment opportunity is going to be a classic hit you won't want to miss out on.
At Bristol & West, we've spotted an opportunity that allows you to benefit from 
investing up to £21,000* tax free. And who better to trust than the no.1 TESSA 
provider on the high street?**
Here's how it works
Have you have made subscriptions into a Cash ISA or TESSA Only ISA between April 1999 and 
the 5th April 2002? If yes, then you now have the opportunity to transfer them in full or 
part into a five year Guaranteed Equity Bond (GEB) Mini Cash ISA, or a six year Balanced 
Guaranteed Equity Bond (BGEB) Mini Cash ISA. Add your Mini Cash ISA allowance for this tax 
year and boost your total investment up to £21,000*. It's history in the making.
Tax free AND risk free
A GEB ISA will provide you with all the excitement of Las Vegas with none of the risk to your capital. Your returns are based on the growth of three major stock market Indexes: the FT-SE 100, 
the Nikkei 225 and the Dow Jones EuroSTOXX 50. You'll enjoy unlimited growth potential, 
plus the security of Bristol & West's 100% capital guarantee. With current interest 
rates falling, this could be an ideal time to take advantage of an investment like this.
Double up and earn even more
Invest in the six year BGEB ISA option, and you can invest up to the same amount again in 
a 12 month Balancing Bond, boosting your potential investment to £42,000. This 12 month 
Balancing Bond is not an ISA but provides a superb guaranteed rate of interest of 
6% gross†/AER††, and allows you easy access whenever you require. It 
certainly deserves a round of applause.
It's now or never

*To benefit from the full potential £21,000 investment, you need to transfer 
£ 3,000 from your Cash ISA for 1999/2000, £3,000 from your Cash ISA for 2000/2001, and £3,000 from your Cash ISA for 2001/2002 and up to £9,000 saved from your matured TESSA. You also need to invest £3,000 in a Mini Cash ISA for tax year 2002/2003. Any interest earned on your previous years' investments can also be transferred into your choice of Guaranteed Equity ISA. The information contained in this flyer is based on Bristol & West's understanding of current law and Inland Revenue practice (October 2001), both of which may change in the future. The law relating to taxation is liable to change and such changes cannot be foreseen.
