 GROW WITH US
 
Our Commercial Finance 
 operation was established in 1990 and has steadily grown. We now have 
 an excellent quality, property based loan book, which currently stands 
 at over £1.7 billion. This is supported by a national team of 
 staff, which has increased, in line with the growth of our business.
 
Northern Rock is 
 fully committed to building upon its achievements to date through continued 
 investment and growth, primarily in our network of Regional Commercial 
 Lending Centres. Within these offices, we consider loans against a wide 
 range of property assets, using a variety of repayment and interest 
 rate options. 
 
We lend to borrowers 
 for residential and commercial investment purposes, with customers from 
 small businesses through to large public limited companies.
 
We aim to:-
 
 
- tailor quality 
 lending facilities in line with borrower&#146;s requirements
 
- structure facilities 
 in a progressive manner
 
- take a practical 
 and flexible approach
 
- provide prompt 
 and meaningful responses, to borrowing proposals 
 
- develop and grow 
 long term successful relationships with our borrowers
 
 
That is why so many 
 of our borrowers return to us and we continue to attract greater numbers 
 of new customers!
