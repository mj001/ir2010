Maxi ISA
 
You may contribute to only one Maxi ISA in any tax year with one
 ISA Manager. Maxi ISAs can be made up of either one, two or all
 three options. You can save up to a total of £7,000 each tax
 year, subject to the following limits for the individual options:
 
 
 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 Cash 
	 £3,000 
	 
	 
	 Stocks and Shares 
	 £7,000 
	 
	 
	 Life Assurance 
	 £1,000 
	 
	 
	 
	 
 
 
 For example, this tax year you could save £3,000 in the Cash
 option and £4,000 in the Stocks and Shares option, or you could save the whole £7,000
 in Stocks and Shares. 
 
Please note that the Cash option within the Maxi ISA is only available for investments within the 2002/03 tax 
 year from customers who have already invested in the Maxi ISA this year. And from 6 April 2002 it will be closed 
 to new investment although any money already saved will continue to grow tax free.

In respect of credit balances with a UK office, payments under the Scheme are limited to 100% of the first £2,000 of a depositor’s total credit balances with the banks and 90% of the next £33,000, resulting in a maximum payment of £31,700. Most depositors, including individuals and small firms, are covered. The Scheme covers deposits made with offices of the bank within the European Economic Area and deposits denominated in all currencies are treated alike. Further details of the Scheme are available on request.
