Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks Annual Results 2001
	 
 8 November 2001
	 
Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks today released their annual results and announced an increase in underlying profits of 10.1%, to £546 million.
	 
Total lending is up 8.7% to £14.07 billion compared with the same period last year, with particularly strong growth in personal loans and tailored business loans.
	 
Retail deposit volumes grew strongly by 9.5% to £9.97 billion, with strong growth in high net worth deposits.
	 
"These figures demonstrate our ability to understand and listen to our customers. It has paid real dividends in the design and launch of new products and services that meet their needs", said Stuart Grimshaw, Chief Executive of Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks.
	 
"Our growth in pre-tax profits reflects prudent provisioning levels in view of the changing economic climate. Following the tragic events in the United States on September 11, while we expect the UK economy to remain on track, we are dealing with an uncertain environment", added Mr. Grimshaw.
	 
This year saw the introduction of particularly successful products like the Flexible Repay mortgage, Guaranteed Equity Bonds and Charity Bonds as well as the launch of Premium Choice. The radical concept of Workplace Financial Services has brought Clydesdale Bank directly to the employees of such corporate giants as Microsoft and BT.
	 
The Banks have continued to expand the number of ways in which the customer can access bank services. A major development was the opening of a second customer contact centre in Kilmarnock, which is expected to create 500 jobs over the next five years. At its peak, the new centre will handle 600,000 calls a month and customers across the UK and Ireland will be able to meet most of their banking needs by telephone.
	 
Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks are in the final phases of the development of Internet Banking. Investment in the ATM network continued and it is now one of the most technically advanced in the country.
 	 
"Alongside the improvements in our ATM network and the development of Internet Banking, the new customer contact centre significantly enhances the Banks' ability to provide customers with a choice of delivery channels. This is critical to the growth of our business as we seek to ensure customers see us as their bank of choice" said Stuart Grimshaw.
	 
In Business Financial Services, total lending was up 11.5%. There was particularly strong growth in the take-up of Tailored Business Loan products, which provide businesses with protection against fluctuations in interest rates.
	 
Investment has continued in the network of Business Banking Centres across the country, including two new flagship centres in Leeds and Teeside. The Clydesdale Bank Business Team in London won some landmark deals in the face of stiff competition.
	 
Two new innovative customer services were launched. Kiboodle is an e-Procurement solution for SME buyers and selected corporate buying organisations. Kiboodle provides a forum for buyers and sellers to sell their products or fulfil their procurement needs on-line through the Internet.
	 
Business Strategy Workshops are a unique collaboration between Clydesdale Bank and the University of Strathclyde Graduate School of Business to provide business customers with a practical insight into competitive strategy.
	 
Children's charities benefited from £40,000 raised from the sale of the Charity Bond products.
