CUSTOMER INITIATIVES
How can you reduce the impact?
 
- Spend legacy cash when you are in the euro zone. (i.e. don't bring back legacy notes and coin from holiday).
 
- Use euro denominated cheques and drafts instead of legacy currencies from September 2001.
 
- Lodge or exchange any legacy cash and cheques as early as possible but no later than 15 February 2002.
 
- If you transact legacy currency business, make sure all of your systems are capable of handling euro before the end of this year.
 
- Start converting legacy accounts to euro early.
