Our credit cards
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A credit 
 card offers you convenience and financial flexibility. 
 You can make better use of your money, especially when you're 
 travelling. We offer a range of credit cards, which will give 
 you more purchasing power wherever you are in the world. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Use your HSBC credit card at over 
 16 million outlets throughout the world. 
 
 
 
 A credit card is essential when 
 booking hotels, hiring cars or paying for that special meal 
 abroad. 
 
 
 
 Travel Money Service - order your 
 foreign currency and travellers cheques by telephone. They 
 will be delivered to your home address within three working 
 days.
