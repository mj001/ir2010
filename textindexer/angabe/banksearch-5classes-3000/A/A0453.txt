*AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest 
 rate would be if interest was paid and compounded each year. Gross interest 
 is the interest rate before income tax deduction at the rate determined by the 
 Inland Revenue. The rates that are shown are variable and may change from time 
 to time.
 **Effective Annual Rate illustrates what the annual interest would be on a debit 
 balance where interest is compounded monthly.
 ***Paid items are items we pay where you may have or have incurred an unauthorised 
 overdraft (including 'Forced to Pay' items such as guaranteed cheques and debit 
 card transactions). 
 
Cash withdrawals made abroad are subject to a 1.5% (minimum £1.50) cash 
 advance charge, in addition to a conversion fee of 2.75% of the value of the 
 transaction. All cash withdrawals from Alliance & Leicester cash machines 
 are free.
If you would like the flexibility of being able to overdraw your account, our 
 Alliance Current Account overdraft facility allows you to draw cash and write 
 cheques up to an agreed limit. There is no arrangement fee or monthly fee to 
 pay, the interest rates are shown above.
Fixed Term overdrafts carry an administration fee of £25. This is in 
 addition to the interest charged on the overdrawn balance. Separate charges 
 are made for international transactions and may also be made for other work 
 of an exceptional nature. All charges are debited to the Alliance Current Account. 
 Interest will normally be paid after tax has been deducted at the rate set by 
 the Inland Revenue. However, if you are registered for gross interest, it will 
 be paid without tax taken off. If you pay more than your liability for tax, 
 you can reclaim the excess from the Inland Revenue. If you are liable to a higher 
 rate tax, you may have to pay extra income tax. For more information, contact 
 your local Inland Revenue office.
Alliance Current Account holders must be aged 18 or over. Written quotations 
 are available on request. Overdrafts are repayable on demand.
