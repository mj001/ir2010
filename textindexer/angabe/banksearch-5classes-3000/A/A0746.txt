"When interest rates change, we will endeavour to tell 
 you as quickly as possible. We will update our web site immediately and 
 either send you a printed copy of the updated Tariff and Interest Rate 
 sheet or will advertise the changes in the following newspapers: The Times; 
 The Financial Times; and The Sunday Times" 
 Deposits made with Citibank International plc. Citibank International 
 plc is a member of the Deposit Protection Scheme established under the 
 Banking Act 1987 (as amended). Payments under the scheme are limited to 
 90% of a depositor's total deposits subject to a maximum payment to any 
 depositor of £18,000 (or euro 20,000 if greater). Most deposits denominated 
 in Sterling, other European Economic Area currencies and euro, made with 
 offices of the Bank within the European Economic Area, are covered. Further 
 details of the scheme are available on request.
 The rates shown apply to the total balance in an account. The gross rate 
 is the rate of interest payable, not taking into account any deduction 
 of income tax. The net rate is the rate paid after allowing for the discharge 
 of liability to income tax at the lower rate of 20% or such other rate 
 that may be applicable under future legislation. AER stands for the Annual 
 Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if interest 
 was paid and compounded each year.
 Interest is calculated daily, compounded and applied monthly unless shown 
 otherwise. Cash deposited into Sterling account will start to earn interest 
 the following day. Interest is paid on a 365 day basis. Interest rates 
 may vary, but are correct at the time of going to press. No withdrawal 
 may be made on Time Deposits, or except in limited circumstances on a 
 TESSA, until the end of the term.
