Hampshire Trust - Commercial Services - Commercial Loans
 
The well qualified and experienced team at Hampshire Trust are proud to be able
to offer a broad variety of loan facilities which are tailor-made to the individual
requirements of the applicant. The particular advantages of dealing with Hampshire Trust
are those of certainty, flexibility and speed.
Customers enjoy certainty because all decisions are taken at Fareham House and
thus there is no delay whilst authority or approval is obtained from some remote location,
since there is none.
One of the Bank&#146;s slogans, &#147;We Always Take A View&#148;, was designed
to make customers and others with whom we deal aware of the flexibility that Hampshire
Trust is able to apply to loan applications. The team have experience in both merchant and
clearing banking and are thus able to assist in assessing and tailoring a broad spectrum
of loans. Many of the staff have particular experience in the property secured lending
environment and thus the Bank is able to offer a wide range of loans secured on commercial
and residential property. Facilities available include loans to purchase and
remortgage, high speed open ended bridging for both residential and commercial
property and development finance for residential and commercial projects. We
also offer a more unusual but very popular restructuring facility that provides the
borrower with the opportunity to make a fresh start.
Our basic
criteria is as follows:-
 
- 
 
Loans
 available from £25,001 to £500,000.
 
- 
 
All
 loans are secured by a first mortgage on property situated in mainland
 England or Wales.
 
- 
 
Maximum
 loan-to-value 70% of the available security.
Since all decisions are made at Fareham House
 speed is
also assured. The
Hampshire Trust team are able to respond without delay in many situations but it is most
clearly demonstrated by the very popular High Speed Bridging facility. This facility is
aimed at those customers wishing to obtain funds within five working days of the date of
the application and is particularly useful for those wishing to purchase or to make a
commitment to purchase a property, but it is by no means limited to such. When high speed
is not quite so important the standard Bridging Loan is available with both open and
closed ended options.
To ensure that Hampshire
Trust really is &#147;The Bank That Stands Out From The
Crowd&#148; the systems and procedures have been developed and fine tuned so that
professional intermediaries and customers alike can be confident of a smooth and efficient
application and loans administration process.
Members of the lending team are particularly happy to discuss matters relating
to the Bank&#146;s lending policy and individual loan enquiries.
