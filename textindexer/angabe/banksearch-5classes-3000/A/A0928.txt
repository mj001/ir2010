	Bank of Scotland has extensive experience of making limited partner investments in funds, with our core activities focusing on private equity houses, whilst considering other asset classes such as property and quoted funds. We have an active understanding of the top-level support required by fund managers, with a growing portfolio now in excess of 85 funds and over £800m of commitments under management.
Our investment rationale is to generate both strong investment returns and to support our acquisition finance opportunities.
Bank of Scotland has created an extensive range of banking products tailored to the specific needs of private equity houses. In addition to becoming an investor, we will consider:
 
	
	
	 
	Gearing funds to improve returns to investors 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	Inter-fund warehouse facilities, during fund raising 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	Bridging and syndication facilities to enable investments to be made prior to requesting drawdown notices from the limited partners whilst easing administration for the fund manager 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	Banking and Treasury facilities 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	Co-investment facilities 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	Regulatory support to fund managers along with co-investment schemes for the fund manager / general partner
Bank of Scotland aims to provide innovative solutions tailored to our customers' needs, with a quick response and competitive pricing. Solutions are found to provide flexibility in the fast changing and often unpredictable climate of fund management.
