Other Browsers 
The Abbey National site is optimised for use with Internet Explorer and Netscape and may
not display correctly in other browsers.
Screen Resolution 
The Abbey National site is best viewed at a resolution of 800x600 pixels. In order to
change the screen resolution on a PC, go to 
START>SETTINGS>CONTROL PANEL>DISPLAY>SETTINGS and change the screen area to
800x600 pixels. On a Mac, go to 
APPLE MENU>CONTROL PANEL>MONITORS in order to change the screen resolution.
Colour 
The Abbey National site is best viewed at a colour-depth of greater than 256 colours
(16bit). In order to change the screen colour settings on a PC, go to
START>SETTINGS>CONTROL PANEL>DISPLAY>SETTINGS and change the colour palette so

to change the colour settings.
Security 
In order to protect your personal details the security encryption level of your browser
should be set at 128bit SSL. This means any information sent or received via the internet
is encoded and secure. This in most cases can be checked in the HELP > ABOUT menu in
the browser. Alternatively, information and upgrades are available from either the Microsoft or Netscape websites.
Javascript 
Java is a programming language. Javascript is used online in web (HTML) documents (and is
what we use for our Abbey National On-line service). It is instantly interpreted by your
browser and will take you to a secure window where you enter your security details. 
To ensure that your computer has its java setting enabled and can view the java window you
need to check: 
(Netscape): EDIT > PREFERENCES > ADVANCED = Look in this section and ensure it
states that java is enabled. 
(Microsoft Internet Explorer): TOOLS > INTERNET OPTIONS >ADVANCED = You will see a
list. Scroll down to the bottom and tick the bottom three boxes.
Cookies 
The Abbey National site use cookies that do not contain personal information and are set
to expire as soon as you leave the site using the LOG OFF button. 
Please ensure that your browser is set to accept cookies using the
EDIT > PREFERENCES > ADVANCED > Please ensure that both sections are ticked (in
Netscape Navigator) or
TOOLS > INTERNET OPTIONS > SECURITY > CUSTOM LEVEL > Please ensure that both
sections are ticked (in Microsoft Internet Explorer) menus.
Partially-Sighted Customers 
Abbey National has improved the accessibility of its On-Line services for blind and
partially sighted customers. We have done this through consultation with the RNIB and by
following as far as possible, the guidelines established by the official Web Accessibility
Initiative (WAI).
Still experiencing problems? 
If your computer meets the minimum requirements but you are still experiencing problems,
here is a checklist of possible causes: 
- - Since security must be tight to protect you, make sure you have 128bit SSL encryption
enabled. This can in most cases be checked in the HELP > ABOUT Internet Explorer menu
in the browser. When the About Internet Explorer window appears, check the Cipher Strength
option. If this is below 128-bit then click on update information. This will take you to
the Microsoft site to download the latest encryption pack. Security information is also available on
the Netscape site. 
- - Make sure that you have enabled your browser's Javascript capabilities by checking the
EDIT > PREFERENCES > ADVANCED (in Netscape Navigator) or TOOLS > INTERNET OPTIONS
> ADVANCED (in Microsoft Internet Explorer) menus. 
- - Make sure that your browser is set to accept cookies, again in the EDIT >
PREFERENCES > ADVANCED (in NetscapeNavigator) or TOOLS > INTERNET OPTIONS >
SECURITY > CUSTOM LEVEL (in Microsoft Internet Explorer) menus. If you have any problems checking these details, help is available from the Microsoft and Netscape websites. 
If you are still experiencing technical problems please contact our e-commerce support
line on 0845 600 4388. This line is open from 7am until 11pm 7 days a week. To help us
improve our service we may record or monitor phone calls.
