What are the benefits?
 
 
- You decide on the level of benefits you require. In other words you 
 want a retirement fund which secures your financial independence throughout 
 your retirement.
 
- Your Plan is written under Trust - this means that it is held by one 
 or more persons (the trustees) for the benefit of other persons (the 
 beneficiaries). Foresight supplies the necessary documentation and secures 
 Revenue approval. Foresight arranges the necessary registration of your 
 Plan with the Pensions Board and assists the Trustees (usually the employer) 
 in ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 1990.
 
- Plan Reviews. It is essential that the benefits being provided under 
 your Plan are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that your pension 
 expectations and your protection, and that of your dependents, are kept 
 in line with earnings and changes in circumstances. Ulster Bank Insurance 
 Services will contact you each year and provide you with information 
 to facilitate your Plan reviews.
 
 
Is Foresight tax efficient?
 
There are a number of features which make the FORESIGHT Retirement Plan 
 the most tax efficient way of providing retirement benefits. Relief is 
 available in accordance with the 1972 Finance Act and current income tax 
 legislation. 
 
Tax advantages
 
 
- Regular contributions made by an employer are deductible for tax purposes 
 as an expense of management in the accounting period in which they are 
 paid. 
 
- Regular contributions of up to 15% of salary can also be made by an 
 employee. Tax relief is given to employees under a net pay arrangement 
 by deducting the contributions from gross pay before PAYE tax deductions 
 are calculated. Tax relief is therefore given immediately at the highest 
 rate of tax paid by the employee.
 
- PRSI relief for both employer and employee is calculated in this manner.
 
- One off contributions (employer and/or employee) to boost funding 
 may also be made from time to time.
 
- The fund(s) in which contributions are invested are exempt from both 
 Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax. This means that returns on these funds 
 will be greater than that for equivalent taxed forms of investment.
 
- At retirement and depending on the number of years service of the 
 employee, up to 1.5 times the employee's your salary may be taken as 
 a tax-free cash lump sum.

What are the benefits 
 for employees/executives?
 Optional benefits which may be provided for employees are:
 
 
- Retirement Pension
 
- Tax Free Lump Sum
 
- Death-In-Service Benefit
 
- Disability Benefit
 
 
Can contributions 
 be flexible?
 The greater the contributions to the Foresight Retirement Plan the 
 bigger the retirement fund that will accumulate. The maximum amount that 
 can be contributed to the Plan depends on each individual case and is 
 subject to Revenue Commissioner's requirements. 
 
Both regular (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly) and once-off 
 single contributions may be made to your Foresight Retirement Plan. Indeed, 
 both regular and single contributions can be made to the same plan.
 
Regular contributions may be increased at any time. In addition to the 
 flexibility this provides contributions may be automatically increased 
 each year.
 
Stopping Contributions
 Provided the accumulated fund has a positive 
 value contributions may be suspended for a period of time.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;

Is there an early retirement 
 option?
 With the employers approval members may take early retirement from 
 age 50 or over. In the event of serious ill health members may retire 
 at any time. Obviously on early retirement the benefits available will 
 be determined by the fund accumulated at that time.
 
What are the benefits 
 on leaving service? 
 On leaving service after 5 years membership of the Plan members are entitled 
 to a personal benefit in accordance with the Pension Act 1900. The benefit 
 will be determined by the contributions invested up to the date of leaving 
 and performance achieved.
 
The value of the preserved benefit may be transferred to the pension 
 plan of a new employer or to a personal retirement bond. If leaving service 
 before five years have elapsed and where there is not a compulsory entitlement 
 to a benefit a member may receive a return in lieu of other benefits of 
 their own contributions (if any) subject to the deduction of tax (currently 
 25%).&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;
 
What are the charges?
 Pension clients need to know that they are getting a good deal for 
 monies invested. As such, our management charging structure has been designed 
 to provide pension clients with excellent value for money over the wide 
 range of pension plan options available.
 
 
- A policy fee of €4.45 per member per month for group schemes
 
- A bid/offer spread units of 5%
 
- An annual fund management charge of 0.75% on Accumulator Units.
 
 
Do 
 Investment allocations vary?
 Depending on the plan chosen, a percentage of each premium is allocated 
 to units over the term of the policy.
