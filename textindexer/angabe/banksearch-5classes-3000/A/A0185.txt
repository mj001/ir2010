The Future's Brick...
In order to show just how bright Orange believes the future can be, the telecommunications giant has created a unique experiment in the heart of the English countryside. Ali Fell investigates for Ulster Business…CLICK FOR FULL STORY
THE FUTURE’S BRICK…
A peaceful farmhouse in the heart of the Hertfordshire countryside may be an unlikely location for a revolution in domestic life, but that is exactly what Orange were aiming for when they created ‘Orange at Home’.
Pitched, on paper at least, as a leading edge research centre, the ‘Orange home’ could be described as a vision of the future, or more specifically as Orange’s vision of the future.
The company realised many people had difficulty grasping the implications that wirefree™ technology had for everyday living. To rectify this, in the most direct way possible, they decided to demonstrate.
There were a number of driving forces behind the project; Orange wished both to develop sophisticated control functions for the sub-systems within the house (heat, lights, security, entertainment etc) and to allow the inhabitants of the house to access these controls simply, and through a variety of methods (voice, WAP, text messaging, web, and wall panels).
Another central concern was that, while those living in the house should experience the benefits of the new technology, they should not necessarily see it. To achieve this, the technology had to be fully integrated within the architecture. However, it was also important to demonstrate accessibility, and therefore imperative they find a suitable existing property, not a new-build, that the technicians and designers could then ‘retro-fit’.
Working alongside design experts Urban Salon throughout the project, Orange developed a ‘virtual’ family, and then created a home based on their needs. The ‘Kendalls’ comprised of mother and father (who works from home), and three children, aged between 18 months and 14-years-old.
Having these ‘personalities’ to cater for meant the designers and technicians could be as creative as they liked within the home. The aesthetics of the house were also important, and the design team worked hard to reflect both family life and the technology behind this very special home in the interior decoration.
The rooms vary greatly, from the high-tech conservatory complete with modular furniture, wall mounted flat-screen TV and solar panelled roof, to the cosy library/sitting room next door. Many of the furniture pieces and artworks in the house are by young British designers, and the overall effect generates a sense of both fun and functionality.
Environmental concerns also played an important part in design. Alongside ‘intelligent’ heating with hot-air recovery, there is a ‘grey water’ system in place. This takes water from the sinks, showers and baths, cleans it, and reuses it to flush the toilets.
The finished house is impressive. It cost around £2 million to refurbish in this way, and is fitted out with the latest version of every kind of gadget, from digital photo frames to robotic lawnmowers.
Occupants will be able to instruct the house to run them a bath, and the house will know automatically which bath to fill, to what depth and at what temperature, for each individual. They will also be able to order their basic food shopping, put the washing on, make the coffee, even open the house remotely, for example, when they are on holiday and someone needs in to feed the cat.
The possibilities are endless. However, Orange weren’t trying to suggest that this is how we will all be living in the near future (although by 2005 they project that one in every five homes will be using at least some intelligent technologies).
The ‘Orange at home’ project was intended originally simply to show what you could do. Although most 14-year-old boys would love it, few parents are actually going to link up a drum machine to the lights in his bedroom, but the Orange home shows that you can… if you want to.
The next phase of life in the Orange home is to try it out for real. It is important for the development of user-friendly technology to discover which of the functions the occupants actually utilise, and how.
It is also central to Orange’s research to see if people are more comfortable with using wall-mounted control panels, or if they embrace the voice command system.
For this reason, a family, fitting the description of the original ‘virtual’ family, will be moving into the house in April, for a period of six weeks. Orange technicians will observe how they use the house, and how the house responds to them. These human guinea pigs are central to the next stage in an exciting development which will impact directly on all of our domestic lives over the next few years.
It may still be experimental, but the future… it’s already here.
