 Remortgage Offers
 
Move your mortgage without moving house, with no
 legal or valuation fees.
 
All our mortgages are available to customers wishing to switch their
 mortgage from their existing lender to the Royal Bank. However, if you want to borrow
 £25,000 or more and have at least 10% equity in your home, consider one of our special
 remortgage packages:
 
Benefits:
 
- No legal or valuation fees
 
- No need to contact your existing lender
 
- Choice of 3 different mortgage types
 
 
Plus:
 
- No Maximum Advance Premium 
 
- Choose how to repay - Capital Repayment, Endowment, Pension Plan or Individual Savings
 Account
 
- Mortgage term can range from 3 years to retirement or age 70, whichever is earlier 
 
 
All of our re-mortgage products offer a full refund on valuation and
 legal fees when using the Bank&#146;s nominated valuer and solicitor. You can also take
 advantage of 3 months&#146; free Mortgage Loanguard premiums.
 
 
 
- Flexible Choice remortgage package
 
 
 
This package is ideal if you want the flexibility to make extra payments into your
 mortgage, take payment breaks or release the equity in your home.
 There is an arrangement fee of £295 for mortgages below £35,000.
 
 
 
- 3 & 5 Year Fixed Rate Re-mortgage
 
 
 
We offer a choice of 3 and 5 year fixed rate
 re-mortgages,
 giving you the security of knowing that no matter what happens to general interest rates,
 your payments will never change during the fixed period. There is an arrangement fee of
 £295, payable when booking a fixed rate. This secures the rate you have chosen for a
 period of three months, meaning that even if we change the fixed rates on offer, or they
 are withdrawn from sale, we will still honour the rate we agreed with you (this fee is
 non-refundable).
 
 
 
- 6 Month Discount Re-mortgage
 
 
 
Take advantage of a substantial 3% discount on our standard
 variable rate until 1 February 2003 &#150; the lower payments let you save money for the
 things you want. There is an arrangement fee of £295 for mortgages below £35,000.
 
 
 
- 2 Year Discount Re-mortgages
 
 
 
Moving to either of our 2 Year Discount re-mortgages allows
 you to make great savings over a longer period of time, with up to 1.5% discount off our
 standard variable rate until 1 August 2004. Our 2 Year Discount with no early repayment
 charge is ideal for customers who don&#146;t want to be tied into their mortgage &#150;
 see the table below for details. There is an arrangement fee of £295 for mortgages below
 £35,000.

Fixed rate mortgages are subject to
 availability of funds. We would advise that, where a fixed rate is
 chosen, funds are booked as soon as possible. The maximum amount for a
 fixed rate mortgage is normally £500,000, however applications in
 excess of this amount will be considered on an individual basis.
