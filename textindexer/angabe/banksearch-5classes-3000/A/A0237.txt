Bank of Ireland Millennium Scholars Trust
 
Thursday 22nd February 2001	
 
To mark the new Millennium, Bank of Ireland has provided £10 million to establish the Bank of Ireland Millennium Scholars Trust. 
 
From 2000, the Trust will provide 60 scholarships a year over a ten year period to people with ability and talent who, because of economic circumstances or other barriers such as disability, are prevented from realising their potential through further study. A number of scholarships may also be awarded to people with exceptional ability who are offered opportunities to pursue further studies which are beyond their financial reach. 
Studies covered by scholarships 
The Trust will help fund people pursuing third level educational opportunities in a broad sense, including conventional degree courses. It will also support individuals who wish to equip themselves through further education to provide leadership in their communities. Gifted people who are offered exceptional opportunities, whether artistic or academic, which are beyond their financial means will also be eligible for scholarships. 
What a scholarship will mean
The Trust will fund education and living costs, substantially relieving recipients of the cost of participating in third level education. The cost of different courses of study may vary as will individual circumstances but scholarships will allow funding of up to £30,000 per person for a four-year course of study. Support will also be given to scholars to help them adjust to their educational environment through a mentoring system run by Bank of Ireland. Scholars may also be offered vacation or seasonal work with Bank of Ireland to assist them during their courses. 
How to apply:
To apply for a scholarship, candidates must be nominated by a Nominating Body registered with the Trust. A wide range of organisations have been invited to act as Nominating Bodies by the Trust, including secondary schools, third level institutions, youth and community groups, arts and cultural organisations. The list of registered organisations will be updated over the lifetime of the Trust and the current list is available on the RoI website www.bankofireland.ie (Application forms for organisations intending to act as Nominating Bodies are available from the Trust Office at the address below.) Nominating Bodies will identify candidates and co-ordinate their applications. It is expected that individuals seeking scholarships will have had close contact with the relevant nominating organisation. 
There is no age limit for applicants. All applicants for scholarships must have been resident in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland for at least one year prior to their application. 
March 1st 2001 is the closing date for receipt of applications in Third-level and current Third-level categories. Foundation/Access courses and Creative Arts have a closing date of April 1st 2001.
Award of scholarships 
Applications received from Nominating Bodies will be assessed by the Trust, with shortlisted candidates called for interview. The award of scholarships will be made by the Trustees whose decision will be final. 
Application forms for scholarships are available from Bank of Ireland branches, the Trust Office, and from Nominating Bodies. 
Application forms for groups intending to act as Nominating Bodies are available from the Trust Office.
