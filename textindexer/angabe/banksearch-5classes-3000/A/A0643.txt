	I'm having problems using Netscape, what should I do?	
	
	To operate Internet Banking using Netscape, we recommend that you use version 4.6 or 4.7.

	Do I need a specific ISP to access your Internet Banking?	
	
	No, you can access the Internet Banking Service through any ISP.	
	
	How do I upgrade my browser?	
	
	If you have an earlier version of a browser, it's easy to download an updated version:
- For Internet Explorer: Browse to www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm 
- For Netscape Navigator: Browse to http://home.netscape.com/download/ 	
	
	Why can I access my account from my home PC but not from work?	
	
	Most computers used in corporate organisations are set up with a server through which all communication passes and this is protected by a firewall. If you are at work and can&rsquo;t connect to our site, it is likely that your company has a firewall. By contacting your system administrator you may be able to arrange access through the firewall.	
	
	When I attempt to log on I receive a message saying I need 128-bit encryption. What does this mean?	
	
	128-bit is a secure form of encryption. Due to the nature of the information being passed between you and ourselves, we use this to ensure that your details cannot be viewed by third parties. Your browser needs to support the 128-bit encryption that our site uses.	
	
	I have upgraded my Netscape browser but I'm still receiving the 128-bit encryption message. What do I do now?	
	
	If you have upgraded your browser from an earlier release the user profile used in that earlier version may have been carried over into the upgraded one. This means it may not be reading the 128-bit encryption. To correct this situation you need to change you user profile. From the start menu click Netscape Communicator, then select Utilities. Select User profile manager, followed by Create new profile. Internet Explorer users will find that their user profile will change automatically once they upgrade to the correct version.	
	
	What do these common error-messages mean?	
	
	If you get the following messages, it may mean you have a modem/network problem and you should contact your ISP or LAN Administrator: 
- Internet Explorer cannot open site; 
- Cannot connect to server;
- The website is unavailable - always check that the URL (Uniform Resource Locator - or simply, the address of a website) you have entered is correct. 
If you get the following messages, it may mean you have an operating system problem. You should close down all other windows programs running on the task bar and run a full virus scan on all files. If the messages continue you should contact your local PC technician:
- Runtime error
- This program has performed an illegal operation	
	
	What if I have a technical problem that is not answered by the FAQ&rsquo;s or online help?	
	
	If you have been through all the questions and your problem has not been resolved please telephone our Internet Banking Help Desk on 08456 000333. The Help Desk is available to answer queries 8am-10pm, Mon-Fri and 9am-6pm, Sat-Sun.
