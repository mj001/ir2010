HomeMortgagesJargon Buster 
We understand that a mortgage is a big commitment and that there are bound to be words and phrases that you’re perhaps unfamiliar with. So to help you, we’ve compiled a list of those that are often mentioned and have tried to explain their meanings in plain English.
- Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
APR represents the total cost of borrowing by taking into account all costs associated with the loan - for example, interest, legal, and valuation fees. By law, all lenders must show the APR alongside their quoted interest rates - it allows borrowers to compare the true cost of borrowing between other lenders in the marketplace. 
- Arrangement Fees
Some providers may charge you to arrange your loan to cover things like administration and management fees.
- BACS
Bank Automated Clearing System. A method of transferring funds from one bank account to another.
- Bank of England Base Rate
The interest set by the Bank of England which is set according to economic conditions. Lenders usually follow it by adjusting their Standard Variable Rate.
- Buildings Insurance
What you must have to protect your property against hazards such as fire, flood and subsidence.
- Buy to Let Mortgage
A mortgage for people who buy property and intend to let it out.
- Capital Repayment Mortgage 
Instalments of capital (that is the actual amount you have borrowed) as well as interest are paid over the period of your loan.
- Capped Rate Mortgage
The interest rate charged by your lender never rises above a specified rate (the "capped rate"), but if the variable rate drops below the capped rate, you will pay the variable rate.	
- CHAPS
Clearing House Automated Payment System. Same day transfer from one bank account to another.	
- Charge
The means by which lenders in England, Wales and Northern Ireland enforce their rights to a property. The charge is recorded at the land registry. A primary mortgage will normally be secured by a first charge.	
- Completion
The point at which the legal formalities of a property purchase or a mortgage are finalised and the funds are released by the lender.
- Contents Insurance
Protection for items in your home, including furniture and personal possessions, in case they're stolen, lost or damaged.
- Credit Check
Enquiry made on the credit history of an applicant, normally by reference to one of the major credit agencies.
- Discounted Rate
A guaranteed reduction on the lender’s variable rate. It is usually only available for an agreed period of time, after which the interest rate reverts to the lender’s variable rate.
- Early Redemption Charges
If the loan is repaid in the early years, you will be charged to cover administration costs. The redemption period varies depending on the terms of your mortgage.
- Endowment Mortgage
An endowment life assurance policy is often linked to a mortgage. Throughout the term of the mortgage, payments the borrower makes are interest only. The proceeds from the policy are then used to pay off the remaining loan amount in one lump sum at the end of the term.
- Equity
The difference between the value of your property and the amount you actually borrowed. Say your house was valued at £80,000 and you have a £60,000 mortgage, your equity would be £20,000. Freestyle Cash Reserve (equity available with a Freestyle Mortgage) is calculated on the difference between the amount you are offered by Standard Life Bank when you take out your mortgage, and the amount you actually borrow. Any overpayments you make also increase your equity.
- Fixed Rate Mortgage
At the start of a mortgage, the interest rate is fixed for an agreed period (usually from two years to ten years) and it is unaffected by changes in the lender’s variable rate. It means that during the specified period, you’ll know exactly how much your monthly repayments will be. At the end of the arranged period, interest on the mortgage will then be charged at the lender’s variable rate or you can take out another fixed rate product if it’s available.
- Individual Savings Account (ISA)
A savings vehicle designed to allow you to invest money tax-free. You could use the returns from an ISA to repay an interest-only mortgage. Standard Life Bank offers the cash element of an ISA.
- Interest-Only Mortgage
Mortgage repayments only consist of interest on the amount you have borrowed. At the end of the mortgage period, you then pay off the actual amount you have borrowed. To do this, you MUST arrange a suitable repayment vehicle - you could use the proceeds from an endowment policy, a personal pension or an ISA.
- Loan to Value (LTV)
The size of a mortgage as a percentage of the value of the property. For example, a £45,000 mortgage on a house that’s valued at £50,000 means a LTV of 90%.
- Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee (MIG) Fee
A charge made by some lenders to take out insurance that covers them if they lend more than their usual ‘loan to value’ limit. If it becomes necessary to repossess a property and the lender cannot recover the full amount of the original mortgage, the lender is then covered by the insurance. At Standard Life Bank, we don’t charge you for this.
- Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance
Covers all or part of your monthly mortgage payment, plus an extra amount to cover mortgage related expenses, for up to 12 months should you lose your
income due to accident, sickness or unemployment.
- Offsetting
Offsetting is the ability to reduce the amount of interest you pay on your debt by not receiving interest on your savings.
- Personal Pension
A personal savings and investment plan designed to provide you with an income when you retire. On retirement, you will receive a lump sum - this can be used to pay off an interest-only mortgage.
- Redemption
Paying off the mortgage, either to move to another property, another lender, or at the end of the mortgage term.
- Redemption Charge
Any charge which might be levied by the lender when the mortgage loan is repaid before the end of the full term.
- Remortgaging
The process of switching your mortgage from one lender to another without actually moving home.
- Repayment Mortgage
Also known as a capital and interest mortgage. Your mortgage repayments are used partly to repay the mortgage amount and partly to pay the interest on the amount you borrowed. 
- Stamp Duty
If you buy a property over £60,000, you are liable to pay government stamp duty which is a percentage of the purchase price. This is a one off payment arranged by your solicitor.
- Standard Security
The means by which lenders in Scotland enforce their rights to a property. The Standard Security is registered at the Land Registry or Register of Sasines.
- Survey
There are various types of survey designed to give an evaluation of the condition and value of a property. The cost varies depending on whether you choose a basic survey which covers the minimum requirements to a full, thorough evaluation. 
- Term
The length of time over which a mortgage is to be paid. 
- Valuation
An independent check of a property by an approved surveyor to help a lender establish how much it’s worth and the amount they are prepared to lend. 
- Variable Rate
The interest rate that the lender charges on the mortgage. It can go down as well as up, which ultimately means that your repayments can go up and down.
