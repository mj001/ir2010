Product Related Charges
Special offer mortgage products carry a charge known as a product related charge. This charge will apply if on or before the charge end date you:
- Redeem your mortgage, unless simultaneously with redemption a new mortgage is completed with us on the same product terms (subject to our normal lending criteria).
- Transfer your mortgage from your current product terms, for example onto a Fixed Rate.
- In certain circumstances repay any capital (except normal monthly payments on a Repayment mortgage).The charge is calculated differently for each special offer/type of product as follows:
- Fixed Rates: The product related charge is based on a number of days additional interest at the fixed rate. The number of days' interest used to calculate the charge will remain the same until the charge end date; the actual amount will depend upon the amount repaid or transferred.
- Discounted Tracker Rates: Where a charge is payable, it will be based on the benefit received under the discount and will be calculated as follows:
Product-related charge / multiplier*
 
X 
Number of whole £1,000s borrowed at the Discounted rate 
X 
Number of whole months borrower has been on the Discounted Rate 
* please remember to apply the particular charge or multiplier related to the product of your choice.
- Cashbacks: In the case of any Cashback, the charge will be based on the amount of the Cashback received and will remain the same until the charge end date and will be calculated on the amount repaid or transferred. Maximum Cashback is £12,000.
- CAT Standard Mortgages: The CAT Standard Mortgage interest rate differential can be varied at any time by Abbey National on 7 days' notice to borrowers subject to the base rate guarantees. The CAT Standard Mortgage cannot be combined with any other products other than a CAT Standard Home Improvement Loan.
Remortgage Solution
Where we arrange for the legal work to be carried out, there will be no charge for this service. However, we will charge a fee equivalent to the costs we have incurred in dealing with the transfer of your mortgage if on or before the charge end date your mortgage is repaid. The fee will not be charged if a new mortgage is completed simultaneously with us.
Where we arrange for the legal work to be carried out, the fee will not exceed £314 for England and Wales, £334 for Northern Ireland, and £399 for Scotland. Where you instruct your own solicitor, the fee contribution will be £250.
The payment of the fee will be in addition to any fee or charge applicable under any other offer condition.
We will not pay for:
Abortive legal costs if the transfer of your mortgage is not completed. In such circumstances the right is reserved to charge for any abortive costs, up to a maximum of £75 plus VAT and any disbursements incurred.
Additional legal costs involved in rectifying title defects, dealing with transfers of equity or any other legal matters not normally associated with a transfer of a mortgage. You will be advised as to the likely cost before any work is undertaken.
Costs you incur in taking your own separate and independent legal advice.
Availability
The minimum additional loan for all special offers is £6,000. Where existing customers are not moving home , special offers can only be applied to the additional loan.
All offers are subject to availability, may be withdrawn at any time and are subject to our normal lending policy (see table below).

General conditions
Customers whose mortgage is subject to a product related charge when a capital repayment is made are allowed to make capital repayments of up to 10% of their outstanding balance as at 1 January each year or the completion balance for loans completing during the year, without incurring a charge. Any repayments in excess of 10% will attract the product related charge on the amount of the excess as set out in the offer conditions.
Tax legislation may change. The value of tax relief depends on your personal circumstances.
Mortgages and secured loans require a charge on your property and are subject to status and valuation and are not available to persons under 18 years of age. Mortgages are only available to UK residents and are only available on UK properties.

What is a Base Rate Tracker?
The Bank of England sets a base rate, known as the repo rate, for lending which is used by banks and building societies, together with other factors, to set interest rates for mortgages and loans. With a base rate tracker mortgage the interest rate on your mortgage will be a percentage above the Bank of England Base Rate. The percentage difference varies for different products within the Classic and Lifestyle range.
Lifestyle Mortgage Rates
- The fixed rate does not apply to the Available Funds facility. Any drawings from the Available Funds facility must be taken at the variable ('Tracker') rate (Base + appropriate tracking differential). No initial discount available. Loans cannot be split between fixed and variable ('Tracker') products. For Abbey National Flexible Mortgages (excluding Future Flexible Mortgages during the discounted period), if there is a credit balance in the Overpaid Funds account then this will reduce the interest charged on the mortgage loan using the same interest as is applied to the mortgage loan.
- Remortgage Solution and Valuation Bonus have a charge end date of 02.07.2004. Please note where any of these benefits are paid to you, in addition to the charge applying to any special offer rate, a charge equivalent to the benefit received will be payable if you redeem your mortgage on or before 02.07.2004.
- The minimum loan size for Flexible Mortgage is £25,000 excluding Available Funds and the maximum is £350,000 including Available Funds. This does not apply to the Large Loan version where the minimum loan size is £200,000.
- Rates are correct at time of going to press.
- The Basic Lifestyle and Classic tracking differential can be varied at any time by Abbey National on 30 days' notice to borrowers on an increase to the differential, and 7 days on a reduction to the differential.
- The Flexible Mortgage differentials can be varied at any time by Abbey National on 3 months' notice to borrowers on an increase to the differential, and 7 days on a reduction to the differential.
- The Flexible Mortgage is administered by Abbey National Mortgage Mortgage Finance plc.
- Overpayments or capital repayments can be used to reduce the term of a repayment mortgage. However, in the case of an investment-backed mortgage, the term can only be reduced if separate arrangements are made for the investment plan itself, although you can still benefit from reduced monthly interest payments.
- The Available Funds Facility is regulated under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and will be documented separately from the mortgage. Certain regulatory requirements will need to be satisfied;these will be explained to you in your mortgage offer. Loans over 90% do not have Available Funds and so are not subject to the Consumer Credit Act.
- All APRs are typical and variable and are based on a repayment mortgage assuming that a High Loan to Value Fee is payable on products where the deposit required is 10% or less. All APRs have been calculated on the basis of the minimum deposit necessary for each individual product.
- Secured loans and mortgages require a charge on your property.
- All secured loan and mortgages are subject to status and valuation and are not available to persons under the age of 18. Written quotations on request. A High Loan to Value Fee will also be required if the loan is equal to or exceeds 90% of the property's valuation (or in certain cases the purchase price, whichever is the lower). The actual fee will be calculated on the amount borrowed above 75% loan to value. There is no High Lon to Value Fee payable on the CAT Standard Mortgages. We require the property to be insured.
- Rates are correct at time of going to press.
- LTV means Loan to Value and signifies the percentage of the property value you wish to borrow.
- Please note, payment by Direct Debit is compulsory on all these products.
- You may transfer your mortgage to another property subject to conditions. These conditions will be set out in your mortgage offer.
- The Basic Lifestyle and Classic tracking differential can be varied at any time by Abbey National on 30 days' notice to borrowers on an increase to the differential, and 7 days on a reduction to the differential.
- For CAT Mortgages, from time to time we will review the differential to ensure it still offers good value for money but it will not necessarily track the Bank of England Base Rate. However, we do guarantee that the differential will not exceed certain amounts. See rate table for more details on amount of differential.
- If you are an existing Abbey National borrower whose mortgage is not administered by Abbey National Mortgage Finance (ANMF) then, if you want to transfer to a CAT Standard Mortgage, your loan will be administered by ANMF. This will involve changes to your mortgage conditions. Full details can be provided on request.These offers are not available:
- To customers who have been in arrears with rent at any time in the last 12 months
- With any additional loans, secured personal loans under £25,000, negative equity, semi-residential loans, any deferred payment, 2-year lower payment or home construction loan and cannot be combined with each other or any other special products as and when they become available.We reserve the right to withdraw the Discounted or Fixed Rate and reclaim the Cashback if:
- The property is no longer occupied by you
- You do not comply with the conditions of your mortgage.
