DEFINITIONS
	*Gross Rate - Gross interest is interest payable without taking account of the deduction of income tax. For most customers, tax will be deducted at the lower rate prevailing at the time of payment (presently 20%)
	
+EAR (Effective Annual Rate) - The effective annual rate is used to express the costof borrowing on current accounts. The EAR takes account of the rate of interest charged, the frequency it is levied to accounts and compounding of interest. It does not include overdraft fees
	
++AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the rate would be if interest was paid and compounded each year.
 As every advert for a savings product which quotes an interest rate will contain an AER, you will be able to compare more easily.
	
**Net - The net rate is the Gross rate less tax at the lower rate of 20%. Tax at this rate will be deducted from accounts subject to tax at the time interest is paid. Non tax-payers may register for payment of Interest Gross. Tax paid may be reclaimed, where appropriate, from the Inland Revenue.
