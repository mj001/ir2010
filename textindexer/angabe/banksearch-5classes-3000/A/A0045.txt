NORTHERN 
 ROCK PLC
 
PRE 
 CLOSE PERIOD ANALYST MEETINGS
 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Northern Rock plc 
 will shortly be meeting analysts ahead of its close period for the six 
 months ending 30 June 2002. This announcement details the information 
 that will be provided at those meetings.
 
OVERVIEW
 
Northern Rock's 
 strategy is one of growth in good quality lending, centred around home 
 ownership. Lending growth generates income growth and drives down unit 
 costs. Funding is generated from a 
 well-balanced franchise of retail deposits, wholesale funds and mortgage-backed 
 securities. Effective use of new technologies helps to improve capacity, 
 enhance distribution and reduce marginal costs - all of which benefits 
 customers and intermediaries and maintains Northern Rock's cost efficiency 
 leadership within the sector.
 
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 
 AND MARKET OUTLOOK
 
Economic forecasts 
 continue to predict a gentle slowdown in 2002 and modest recovery in 
 2003. The housing market remains both large and robust: affordability 
 and consumer confidence are good. A slowdown in house price growth is 
 anticipated as interest rates and unemployment begin to rise, which 
 should help to keep affordability within long term trend levels.
 
Current forecasts 
 for mortgage lending in the UK for 2002 predict strong volumes. This 
 should, naturally, help our performance. A slower housing market will 
 not disrupt our high growth story, which is underpinned by our increasing 
 cost advantage. This will continue to be a differentiating factor for 
 Northern Rock compared to the rest of the mortgage market.
 
LENDING
 
Lending has been 
 strong in all areas with our share of net residential lending in line 
 with achieving at least twice "par" levels. Our total net 
 lending is up by over 50% compared to last year. We have seen a notable 
 increase in re-mortgaging business as borrowers are leaving their existing 
 lenders to enjoy the more attractive products offered by Northern Rock. 
 The pipeline of agreed business has increased to £3.5 billion 
 (cf. £3.3 billion as at end Q1 2002) ensuring solid lending momentum 
 going forward. Our transparent and equitable policy of allowing existing 
 customers to have any product available to new customers has helped 
 to see our share of residential redemptions stay well below our natural 
 share.
 
The quality of our 
 loan books remains strong. Our residential lending arrears are less 
 than half the industry average, and the absolute number of cases 3 months 
 or more in arrears has fallen from 2,525 at the end of 2001 to 2,433 
 as at the end of April 2002. The credit quality of all other forms of 
 lending (i.e. commercial, unsecured and credit cards) is also good. 
 
 
 FUNDING
 
Funding from all 
 our three sources (i.e. retail, wholesale and securitisation) has been 
 well-balanced and strong.
 
Retail intake has 
 been positive, supported by fixed rate bonds, on-line tracker products 
 and cash ISA sales; and retail balances - which are expected to grow 
 by around £600 million during H1 2002 - still fund about 50% of 
 our balance sheet assets.
 
We continue to take 
 advantage of wholesale funding and securitisation. On the wholesale 
 front, with the expectation of interest rate rises, we have moved to 
 more medium term funding and swaps to protect our fixed rate lending 
 exposure to such increases. We are at the forefront in the UK market 
 in residential mortgage-backed securities and so far this year we have 
 already issued £2.4 billion of securitised notes - placed in Sterling, 
 Euro and US Dollar markets - setting new benchmark levels which reflect 
 the high quality of our assets.
 
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
 
Spreads and margins 
 have remained relatively stable during the first five months of 2002. 
 As expected, greater use of securitisation and Libor increases will 
 have a modest, adverse effect on spreads. 
 
We are very successful 
 at up-selling products to our customer base, and anticipate that our 
 growth in Other Income will exceed our Balance Sheet growth. Through 
 a combination of relatively stable margins and high trading volumes, 
 we expect total income growth to be comfortably within our low-to-mid 
 teens range at the half year stage.
 
COSTS
 
Cost efficiency 
 is a key focus for Northern Rock. Our strategic target is to restrict 
 cost growth to between one half to two thirds of the growth in assets 
 under management and less than income growth. With cost growth at the 
 low to mid point of our strategic range, we will see a further reduction 
 in both unit cost ratios at the half year stage.
 
At the same time, 
 we continue to invest to support the Company's high growth strategy. 
 A £50 million expansion of the Head Office site in Gosforth will 
 accommodate future growth in capacity and improve service to both customers 
 and intermediaries. This, in turn, should bring about further improvements 
 in our unit cost ratios.
 
PROVISIONS
 
The quality of our 
 lending has been strong. Our arrears continue to improve and provisioning 
 remains prudent. A key feature has been the cautious volume-driven increase 
 in Unsecured Lending provisioning.
 
PROFITS
 
The range of those 
 pre-tax profit forecasts which reflect the new accounting treatment 
 of Reserve Capital Instruments is £309m to £321m (2001: 
 £276.5m). We anticipate profit growth to be around the mid-teens 
 for 2002 and are, therefore, comfortable with the top end of that range. 
 
 
 COMMENT
 
Adam J Applegarth, 
 Chief Executive commented: "Northern Rock's lending performance 
 in the first five months of 2002 has been very strong. We are ahead 
 of target and are building on the excellent progress we made in 2001." 
 
 
 Further, more detailed, 
 information on Northern Rock's H1 2002 trading performance will be produced 
 at the time of the Interim Results - to be announced on Thursday 18 
 July 2002 (Note: brought forward from Thursday 25 July 2002).

NORTHERN 
 ROCK Q1 TRADING STATEMENT
 
 Northern Rock takes 
 the opportunity to inform the market of its current strong trading performance; 
 particularly that its record lending in 2001 has continued throughout 
 Q1 2002 and is also expected to be strong in Q2 2002. This performance 
 is in line with its strategic intention of taking a market share for 
 the current year of net residential lending of 7-8%, around twice its 
 natural share of stock, which was 3.8% at 1 January 2002. 
 
Lending
 
Compared to the 
 first quarter of 2001, total gross lending and total net lending have 
 both increased by more than 35%, with net residential lending higher 
 by more than 55%. Northern Rock starts Q2 with a pipeline of agreed 
 business of over £3.3 billion - 50% higher than at the same time 
 last year. Redemptions have continued to run noticeably lower than natural 
 share, a reflection in part of the transparency of new customers' products 
 being available to all existing mortgagors.
 
Mortgage arrears 
 - including Together loans - continue to be tightly controlled and the 
 level of arrears at more than three months duration remains below half 
 the industry average. Unsecured personal loans and the secured commercial 
 portfolio are also performing well. Northern Rock has no residential 
 loan exposure outside the UK nor any exposure to unsecured corporate 
 lending or leasing.
 
Funding
 
Funding has been 
 well-balanced and strong. Wholesale monies and the growth in personal 
 savings have both been positive and have met expectations; and, in addition, 
 during March Northern Rock successfully completed its sixth securitisation 
 transaction raising £2.4 billion. Notes were placed in Sterling, 
 Euro and, benefiting from SEC registration, the US Dollar markets, in 
 line with the Company's objectives and retaining its position at the 
 forefront of securitisation of residential mortgages in the UK.
 
Costs
 
Cost control remains 
 a key focus for Northern Rock and cost growth is within the Company's 
 strategic target of being less than total income growth and between 
 one half to two thirds of the rate in asset growth. This ensures unit 
 costs continue to fall.
 
Accounting for 
 Reserve Capital Instruments ("RCIs")
 
The current range 
 of market expectations of pre-tax profit for 2002 is £310m to 
 £342m. This does not reflect the recent required change to the 
 accounting treatment for RCIs following the introduction of UITF 33, 
 the effect of which will be to marginally enhance our profit attributable 
 to shareholders, return on equity and earnings per share but will reduce 
 our profit before tax. This is because the coupons for our RCIs (adjusted 
 for grossing up of tax and the Foundation covenant) will be treated 
 as a pre, not post, tax deduction.
 
After adjusting 
 for the new accounting treatment for RCIs, Northern Rock remains comfortable 
 with market consensus profit expectations. 
 
 Economic Background 
 & Market Outlook
 
Affordability remains 
 at sustainable levels given the UK economy as a whole. The housing market 
 remains both large and robust and the mortgage market - especially with 
 the opportunity to remortgage at relatively low interest rates - is 
 set to be sufficiently large for Northern Rock to achieve its lending 
 targets. 
 
In the medium term, 
 signs of a modestly slowing economy may have an impact on housing demand, 
 but this should be offset by a combination of a shortage of new housing 
 and historically low interest rates. 
 
Comment
 
Adam J Applegarth, 
 Chief Executive, commented: "Operating performance in the first 
 quarter of the year continues to be very good. It is in line with expectations 
 and builds on the strong progress we made in 2001. We are set to deliver 
 against our low cost, high growth strategy."
 
 A further pre-close period announcement will be made towards the end 
 of May and a more detailed report on Northern Rock's performance will 
 be provided at the time of the Interim results which will be announced 
 on Thursday 18 July. (Note: brought forward from Thursday 25 July.)

 NORTHERN ROCK PRE CLOSE PERIOD ANALYST MEETINGS
 
Background
 
Northern Rock plc will shortly be meeting analysts ahead of its close period for the twelve months ending 31 December 2001. This announcement details the information that will be provided at those meetings.
 
Overview 
 
 
Northern Rock's virtuous circle strategy uses our low cost operations along with product innovation, technology and customer friendly distribution to produce good products at competitive prices. This leads to strong growth in high quality assets to provide low risk, attractive returns to shareholders. This strategy seems especially valid in current market conditions.
 
Operating performance for the year is at the top of the range of expectations, building on the strong progress made in 2000. Financial results are also anticipated to be in line with our operational performance and we therefore remain comfortable that we will achieve results at the top end of the consensus range; (PBT Range £282m to £294m based on current published estimates from 14 major analysts).
 
Lending
 
Lending volumes have been good in all areas, with net lending up over 40% year to date compared to the same period last year, delivering a share of net residential lending on target at around twice "par" levels. The level of mortgage business at Northern Rock has remained strong throughout 2001. Enquiries for Northern Rock products have remained buoyant in October and November.
 
Within residential lending we have further strengthened our product range with the launch of together connections - an off-setting variation of together. This product is proving attractive to customers and the together family of products continues to perform well in comparison to more traditional type loans.
 
The improved lending and product mix has allowed the average cost of acquisition to continue to fall despite high volume growth. New loan business volumes are strong with a pipeline of £2.4 billion of agreed, but not yet completed, loans at the end of November, compared to £1.9 billion at the end of December last year. Our transparent and fair policy of allowing existing customers to have any product available to new customers has helped to see our share of residential redemptions stay well beneath our natural share
 
Arrears and Provisions
 
The quality of our lending remains good with arrears in residential lending remaining at less than half the industry average. We see no current deterioration in credit quality in our residential, secured commercial or unsecured personal loan books - with the absolute number of arrears at the end of 2001 set to finish lower than the end of last year. Naturally, therefore, arrears as a proportion of the number of loans has also fallen substantially. As a result of the uncertainties created by recent events and the deteriorating outlook for the world economy, including the UK, we have prudently decided that we will increase certain provisions for the current financial year. This also reflects the higher volumes of business we have generated as a result of our additional growth this year.
 
Treasury
 
Northern Rock's Treasury function acts as an integrated part of the business not as a separate profit centre. Over 96% of our Liquid Assets are invested in Investments grade A or better. The quality of this portfolio is illustrated by the fact that we have no exposure to ENRON the US Energy Company
 
 Funding
 
Funding from all areas has grown and continued to diversify. Retail balances still fund 50% of balance sheet assets. We continue to take advantage of wholesale funding and securitisation opportunities. We have issued £3 billion of securitised notes during 2001, and retain our position at the forefront of securitisation of residential mortgages in the UK. Retail intake has been good, supported by fixed rate bonds and Cash ISA sales, allowing further selling opportunities.
 
Total net funding in 2001 will be around £6 billion.
 
Operating Performance
 
Spreads and margins have benefited both from lower loan acquisition costs and from lower base rates and therefore are better than predicted at the half year. As a result of higher total income margins and incremental volumes, total income growth will be in excess of our mid-teens target.
 
Costs 
 
 
We continue to invest for growth. Cost growth is expected to be below the mid point of our target range of half to two thirds of growth of assets under management and is also set to be less than income growth. We expect both unit cost ratios to show improvement.
 
E-Commerce
 
Northern Rock's integrated e-commerce platform continues to show substantial progress in generating further business volumes and supporting our aim of driving down unit costs. So far this year, around 10% of all loans by value were originated from this source.
 
Economic Background and Market Outlook
 
The UK economy is expected to see growth slow to around the 2% level next year. Whilst unemployment is set to rise, interest rates are at a 40 year low, meaning that affordability indices are well within their long term sustainable trend bands and are around half the levels seen at the start of the 1990s.
 
Prospects for house price increases have moderated and are at levels sustainable given the UK economy as a whole. The housing market remains both large and robust and the mortgage market - especially with the opportunity to remortgage at very low interest rates - is set to be sufficiently large for Northern Rock to achieve our strategic target levels of lending.
 
Summary 
 
Northern Rock has delivered against its strategy in 2001 and is set to continue to do so.
 
Further, more detailed, information on our 2001 trading performance will be provided at the time of the preliminary results - to be announced on Wednesday 30 January 2002.
 
Comment 
 
Adam Applegarth, Chief Executive, said "Northern Rock's performance is very strong and on target. The future prospects for our strategy (of good lending growth feeding through to strong financial performance) continue to be attractive".

NORTHERN 
 ROCK Q3 TRADING STATEMENT
 
 Northern Rock announces 
 that its buoyant lending performance of the first half of 2001 has continued 
 in Q3 and is also set to be strong in Q4. This is in keeping with the 
 strategic target of having a market share of new residential lending 
 at twice natural share of stock.
 Northern Rock remains comfortable with the top end of market expectations 
 of profit performance, with total income margins remaining stable, as 
 seen during H1.
 
Lending
 
Total gross lending 
 was 67% higher and net lending more than double in Q3 than the same 
 quarter last year. This resulted in a 43% increase in net lending for 
 the year to the end of Q3 compared to the same period last year. Northern 
 Rock starts Q4 with a pipeline of agreed business of over £2.2 
 billion - 34% higher than the same time last year. 
 Redemptions continued to run noticeably lower than natural share, a 
 reflection in part of the transparency of new customers' products being 
 available to existing customers.
 Credit quality remains extremely robust across all forms of Northern 
 Rock's lending, with no signs of deterioration. Arrears in residential 
 lending remain under half the industry average. Northern Rock, of course, 
 has no residential loan exposure outside the UK nor exposure to unsecured 
 corporate lending or leasing.
 
Funding
 
All three funding 
 arms - retail, wholesale, and securitisation - have performed well. 
 The latest tranche of securitisation - £11/2 billion of which 
 almost two thirds was in US Dollars - was completed last week - a reflection 
 of not only the credit quality of Northern Rock's loans but also the 
 ability of financial markets to recover and the desire for this type 
 of asset-backed financial instrument.
 
Costs
 
Cost control remains 
 strong, and cost growth is within the Company's strategic target of 
 less than two thirds of the rate of asset growth. This ensures unit 
 costs continue to fall. 
 
Market Outlook
 
The level of mortgage 
 enquiries at Northern Rock has remained strong over the last 3 weeks 
 - despite recent events. Lower interest rates directly help loan repayment 
 abilities, and contribute to maintaining momentum in the economy generally. 
 
 In the medium term, it may be that weaker consumer confidence feeds 
 through to the housing market. This should mean a rate of growth in 
 the housing market more in keeping with that of the economy as a whole. 
 This should prevent affordability indices moving to unmaintainable levels 
 and therefore create a more sustainable housing market. 
 
General Outlook
 
Adam Applegarth, 
 Chief Executive commented: "Northern Rock, with our narrow lending 
 focus in the UK, does not face some of the credit quality questions 
 seen by banks with wider activities. The housing market may see some 
 of its froth disappear - a good thing to happen before the general market 
 became unsustainable. The outlook for the mortgage market is good enough 
 for Northern Rock - the most cost efficient bank - to achieve our strategic 
 goals. In difficult times, Northern Rock is well placed to continue 
 to prosper".

 NORTHERN 
 ROCK PRE CLOSE PERIOD ANALYST MEETINGS
 
Background
 
Northern Rock plc 
 will shortly be meeting analysts ahead of its close period for the six 
 months ending 30 June 2001. This announcement details the information 
 that will be provided at those meetings. 
 
Overview 
 
 
Northern Rock's 
 strategy is one of high quality growth in lending - mainly residential. 
 This growth in lending generates other income growth as well as driving 
 down unit costs. Effective use of new technologies helps to improve 
 capacity, reduce marginal costs as well as enhancing distribution. Funding 
 comes from a well-balanced franchise of retail deposits, wholesale funds 
 and mortgage backed securities. 
 
Operating performance 
 in the first half of the year is in line with expectations, building 
 on the strong progress made in 2000. Results for the first half of 2001 
 are anticipated to be in line with our expectations and we remain comfortable 
 with market forecasts for the full year. 
 
Lending
 
 Northern Rock's 
 strong performance has continued into 2001 in line with the company's 
 strategy. Lending has been strong in all areas, with our share of net 
 residential lending around twice "par" levels. Within residential lending 
 we have further strengthened our product range with the launch of together 
 connections. Initial indications are that this product is proving 
 very attractive to our customers and the together family of products 
 continues to perform well in comparison to traditional loans. 
 
The improved lending 
 and product mix has allowed the average cost of acquisition to continue 
 to fall despite strong growth. The quality of our lending remains strong 
 and provisioning remains prudent.
 
 Funding
 
Funding in all areas 
 has grown and continued to diversify. Retail balances still fund 50% 
 of our balance sheet assets: however, as we grow, we continue to take 
 advantage of wholesale funding and securitisation opportunities. We 
 have issued a further £1.5 billion of securitised notes in the first 
 half of 2001, and retain our position at the forefront of securitisation 
 of residential mortgages in the UK. 
 
Operating Performance
 
 Total income margin 
 to balance sheet assets remains stable for the year. Costs remain tightly 
 controlled and this will be reflected in our ratios. 
 
Capital Efficiency 
 
 
Capital continues 
 to be managed efficiently with a further issue of £100m of Reserve Capital 
 Instruments in the first half of the year, to add to the £200m placement 
 last year. 
 
E-Commerce 
 
 
Northern Rock's 
 integrated e-commerce platform continues to show substantial progress. 
 Continued development throughout this year will generate further business 
 volumes and support our aim of continuously striving to drive down unit 
 costs. 
 
Summary 
 
Northern Rock is 
 set to continue to deliver against its strategy. Further, more detailed, 
 evidence will be provided at the time of the Interim results - to be 
 announced on Thursday 19 July.

ANNUAL 
 GENERAL MEETING STATEMENT
 
Northern 
 Rock plc takes the opportunity to inform the market of its current trading 
 performance, in substantially the same terms as The Chairman will be 
 informing shareholders at today's Annual General Meeting. 
 
During the first quarter of 2001, Northern Rock's trading performance 
 has continued to be very strong. All forms of lending, residential, 
 commercial and personal credit are performing well and in line with 
 the Company's growth strategy.
 
Our lending is comfortably ahead of the trading volumes seen in the 
 corresponding period of 2000. Indeed, net lending at the 
 end of the first quarter 2001 is 25% higher than the corresponding period 
 last year, reflecting the strong pipeline of new business carried into 
 this year. New residential applications in the first quarter are showing 
 a 24% increase over the equivalent period last year, which itself was 
 buoyant. The pipeline of applications and uncompleted awards has risen 
 to £2.2 billion at the end of March 2001. It is expected that net residential 
 lending market share in the first quarter will be double the Company's 
 share of outstanding stock. Mortgage arrears continue to be tightly 
 controlled and the level of arrears of more than 3 months duration remains 
 at half the industry average.
 
Levels of service throughout the Company remain strong. The Decision 
 Call Centre, set up last year to improve the efficiency of mortgage 
 application processing, guarantees qualifying loan awards within service 
 turnaround standards. Our E-Commerce operation continues to contribute 
 significantly - and effectively - to the trading performance.
 
Funding has been well balanced and strong. Wholesale monies and the 
 growth in personal savings have met expectations and in addition during 
 March Northern Rock successfully completed its fourth securitisation 
 transaction raising £1.5 billion. Notes were placed in both the Sterling 
 and, benefiting from SEC registration, the US Dollar markets, in 
 line with the Company's objectives.
 
Adam Applegarth, Chief Executive, said:
 
"Northern Rock is performing well and is set to continue to deliver 
 its low cost, good quality, high growth strategy. We remain comfortable 
 with Analysts' expectations of Northern Rock for 2001."

BOARD 
 CHANGES
 
Northern Rock plc 
 announces today that it is proposed that Leo Finn will retire from the 
 Board of the Company following its Annual General Meeting to be held 
 on 24 April 2001. He is to be replaced as Chief Executive on 1 March 
 2001 by Adam Applegarth, aged 38, currently an Executive Director of 
 the Company.
 
Sir John Riddell, 
 Chairman, said 'Leo Finn has given many years of valuable service to 
 Northern Rock. He led a very successful flotation in 1997 and has created 
 a clear strategy for the future based on growth, efficiency, credit 
 quality and the effective use of technology and people. 
 
'Replacing him has 
 involved us searching the market for the best external talent. But potential 
 appointees had to be compared with the best of our home grown executives 
 and I am delighted that Adam Applegarth has emerged successfully from 
 this search for a successor.
 
'In Adam's appointment 
 we are able to ensure the continuity of the successful development of 
 Northern Rock. As we indicated in our Stock Exchange announcement earlier 
 this week, we are meeting all our strategic and operational targets 
 and look forward to the future with confidence'.

NORTHERN 
 ROCK PRE CLOSE PERIOD ANALYST MEETINGS
 
Background
 
Northern 
 Rock plc will shortly be meeting analysts ahead of its close period 
 for the year ending 31 December 2000. This announcement details the 
 information that will be provided at those meetings.
 
Overview
 
Northern 
 Rock's strategy is one of high quality growth in lending - mainly residential. 
 This growth in lending generates other income growth as well as driving 
 down unit costs. Effective use of new technologies helps to improve 
 capacity, reduce marginal costs as well as enhancing distribution.
 
Funding 
 comes from a well-balanced franchise of retail deposits, wholesale funds 
 and mortgage backed securities.
 
Operating 
 performance in the second half is in line with expectations, building 
 on the company's first half achievements. The 2000 financial results 
 are anticipated to be in line with our expectations and we are comfortable 
 with market forecasts.
 
Lending
 
Northern 
 Rock's strong performance has continued in the second half of the year 
 and the year as a whole has been consistent with its strategy.
 
Lending 
 has been strong in all areas, with net lending expected to be roughly 
 double 1999's total and net residential lending around twice "par". 
 Within residential lending the Together product has proved very attractive 
 to customers and these loans have continued to perform well in comparison 
 to traditional loans. 
 
The 
 improved lending and product mix has allowed the average cost of acquisition 
 to continue to fall despite strong growth. The quality of our lending 
 remains strong and provisioning remains prudent.
 
Funding
 
Funding 
 in all areas has grown and continued to diversify. Having become an 
 SEC reporting company, Northern Rock has a strong platform to ensure 
 international geographic diversification of funding sources continues. 
 Retail funding will again show sensible growth in both halves of the 
 year. Securitisation issues now total £2.65bn with the latest issue 
 (3rd) being more representative of the book as a whole. Northern Rock 
 is - and intends to remain - at the forefront of securitisation of residential 
 mortgages in the UK.
 
Operating 
 Performance
 
Total 
 income margin to balance sheet assets remains stable for the year.
 
Costs 
 - which include strong investment in emerging technology - remain tightly 
 controlled and this will be reflected in the cost ratios.
 
Published 
 post-tax profits will benefit from the inclusion of the "one off" £10m 
 tax credit relating to previously disallowed conversion costs.
 
Capital 
 Efficiency
 
Capital 
 continues to be managed efficiently with two capital issues having been 
 effected this year, a £200m Reserve Capital Instrument and a £40m Tier 
 2 placement.
 
E-Commerce
 
Northern 
 Rock's integrated e-commerce platform continues to show substantial 
 progress. The next stages - with the earlier moves being about expanding 
 distribution to customers - are concentrating on further ties with intermediaries 
 and reducing transaction costs.
 
Summary
 
A renewed 
 Northern Rock is set to continue to deliver against its strategy. Further, 
 more detailed, evidence will be provided at the time of the preliminary 
 results - to be announced on Wednesday, 31st January 2001.

Important 
 Notices
 
This 
 announcement should be read in conjunction with our interim announcement 
 for the 6 months ended 30th June 2000, copies of which are available 
 from Northern Rock plc, Northern Rock House, Gosforth, Newcastle upon 
 Tyne, NE3 4PL or on our website at www.northernrock.co.uk. 
 
This 
 announcement includes forward-looking statements with respect to the 
 financial condition and results of operations of Northern Rock, which 
 by their nature involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to 
 events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. Although 
 Northern Rock believes that the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates 
 and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, 
 Northern Rock cautions readers that a number of factors could cause 
 actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in such 
 forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited 
 to, competition, consumer spending, saving and borrowing patterns, and 
 the level of inflation, interest rates and exchange rates.

NORTHERN 
 ROCK SPRING STATEMENT 
 
Northern 
 Rock has made significant progress in the first quarter of the year. 
 
 
All 
 lending is on target with residential mortgage lending particularly 
 buoyant. In the first three months, residential net lending was more 
 than double 1999's figure, reflecting a very strong gross completions 
 performance. This will translate into an estimated market share for 
 UK net residential lending over twice the Company's natural share. 
 
Equally 
 encouraging was that the level of new residential awards was also almost 
 twice last year's level. 
 
The 
 good progress has resulted from the successful implementation of the 
 Company's new hi-tech Decision Call Centre, increased volumes via the 
 internet and the wide appeal of "together", the Company's innovative 
 combined credit product. 
 
Plans 
 to combine all technological distribution channels are on target. Already 
 15% of all residential and 83% of personal credit applications are originated 
 through the Company's integrated site. 
 
Leo 
 Finn, Chief Executive, commented: "We promised a strong start 
 to the year which has been delivered. We are convinced that e-commerce 
 integration is the key and thus far our results support our contention.
 
"We 
 intend to follow this path rapidly. Our aim is to continue to reduce 
 our already very low unit costs. I believe that low cost multi-channel 
 delivery is a winning strategy giving customers transparency, comparison 
 and choice." 
 
ADDITIONAL 
 INFORMATION 
 
E-Commerce 
 Strategy: Northern Rock's e-commerce strategy has two prongs. The 
 first is to offer products directly to customers with customer choice 
 being the key. The various distribution channels - branch, telephone, 
 post and e-commerce - are being developed as an integrated service, 
 with NR Direct and northernrock.com as a single integrated site. All 
 products already have on-line applications and by the end of 2000 all 
 will be fully transactional. 
 
Northern 
 Rock sees digital TV as both a future major driver in accessing direct 
 customers and keeping down unit costs. 
 
The 
 second prong of e-commerce is through "Business to Business", 
 in particular to both the existing and new generation of loan intermediaries 
 and information providers, as well as for resource purchasing and hence 
 cost management. 
 
Decision 
 Call Centre: Launched in mid February. Provides on-line guaranteed 
 loan decisions to intermediaries who account for around 60% of Northern 
 Rock's residential loan business. This is the largest automated call 
 centre in the UK to support national intermediaries. 
 
The 
 average length of call to get a guaranteed loan is 12 minutes. 
 
This 
 decision module has now also been introduced at the integrated Northern 
 Rock Direct/northernrock.com site to extend the guaranteed loan service 
 to direct customers.
 
 "together": 
 Northern Rock's unique loan product combines a maximum of 95% LTV residential 
 loan with an unsecured personal loan and a credit card all at one competitive 
 rate. 
 
Safeguarding 
 customers 
 
 
- Savings Pledge: 
 Northern Rock writes out to individuals when it either launches new 
 products or changes interest rates (and gives notice of any interest 
 rate reductions at least equivalent to the notice period on the customer&pi;s 
 account). 
 
 
 
- Mortgage Base 
 Rate Guarantee: During any redemption penalty period Northern 
 Rock guarantees that its Standard Variable Rate will be no more than 
 1.99% above UK Bank Base Rate. 
 
 
 
- Extra Safeguards 
 for Borrowers: 
 
 
- Mortgage 
 Indemnity Guarantee premiums have been abolished 
 - Any new redemption charges are both tapering and spelt out in 
 £ value at the time a loan is taken out
 - When redemption charges do apply, repayments can be made up 
 to 15% per annum of the value of a loan without any redemption 
 penalty 
 - Any overpayment over £200 immediately means monthly payments 
 are adjusted (if the customer wishes) 
 - All new loan deals are portable 
 - There are no compulsory insurances

PROGRESS REPORT 
 AND STRATEGY UPDATE FROM NORTHERN ROCK 
 
Northern Rock 
 is taking the opportunity to update investors on the encouraging progress 
 it has made in implementing its strategy since its interim results in 
 July of this year. 
 
Leo Finn (Chief 
 Executive) said: "Northern Rock is renewing itself. Our size and 
 focus allow us to respond early and quickly to changing markets and 
 customer preferences. We are changing shape to meet a demanding future." 
 
 
Northern Rock's 
 strategy is to seek high levels of profitable lending growth, funded 
 by an economically appropriate mix of personal savings, wholesale funds 
 and securitisation issues. Such lending growth both provides capital 
 to grow the business further and gives better returns to shareholders. 
 Cost-efficiency is a key element in achieving this.
 
Mr Finn added: 
 "The next essential elements of enhancing our strategy of profitable 
 growth are effective E-commerce, continued efficiency and improved funding 
 capabilities." 
 
As a result, in 
 order to underpin its return to higher growth of both assets under management 
 and profits, Northern Rock is taking further actions announced today: 
 
 
 
- Northern Rock 
 will build on the current success of its Personal Savings arm by the 
 launch of cash deposit activities in Ireland, based on telephone, 
 post and internet facilities - further details of this will be provided 
 on 16 November at a Press Conference in Dublin. This venture will 
 be in partnership with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), 
 which already administers Northern Rock (Guernsey) operations. This 
 move for personal savings builds on the successful capital markets 
 issues in Europe and the US earlier this year and complements other 
 funding vehicles such as its Securitisation programme - the second 
 issue of which is scheduled for February 2000. 
 
 
 
- Northern Rock 
 will increase its already successful E-commerce activities. Much progress 
 has already been made in moving from a simple website (essentially 
 an electronic advert) towards a full E-commerce site. Northern Rock's 
 core personal business areas of lending (residential and personal 
 credit), retail funding and protection insurance will all be on the 
 E-commerce site and will have on-line applications, transactions and 
 customer service. The business areas will be brought on-stream in 
 stages during 2000. For example last week, Together - a key mortgage 
 product - was opened up to allow on-line applications. 
 
 
 
- A new automated 
 Mortgage Decision Call Centre - guaranteeing loan awards and service 
 turnaround standards for both direct and intermediary business - will 
 be launched early next year. This call centre will employ 100 staff 
 in Doxford, Sunderland. It will be based on the proven Omiga mortgage 
 processing system already successfully introduced into Northern Rock 
 and built in partnership with Marlborough Sterling Group. * To create 
 higher levels of customer service across the whole range of its core 
 business, to support E-commerce and to meet the demands of growth, 
 Northern Rock will employ a further 300 staff at its Newcastle headquarters. 
 
 
 
These initiatives 
 will improve Northern Rock's funding and lending efficiency and its 
 service to customers, but cost efficiency remains paramount. 
 
Mr Finn said: 
 "The net financial cost implications of our moves will not be material. 
 We are transferring costs from old or unwanted activities to new areas 
 - one of our key strengths. Our commitment to efficiency, represented 
 by lower cost ratios, remains undiminished. In my experience, effective 
 cost management is best achieved by well planned incremental shifts, 
 which is exactly what we are doing."
 
As a result: 
 
 
- Northern Rock 
 is closing 29 out of its current 105 branches by the end of 
 this year. These closures are of units with declining business volumes 
 and are not expected to affect funding or lending performance. A total 
 of 250 jobs will be lost - leaving an overall net increase of 150 
 jobs. 
 
 
 
- Northern Rock 
 is in advanced negotiations regarding the sale of its Regency Care 
 Homes to NHP, a leading player in the care homes sector. The sale 
 is expected to be completed in December and will be the subject of 
 a fuller announcement at that time. Northern Rock will no longer have 
 any direct interests in that sector from that date. 
 
 
Northern Rock 
 is determined to continue to be efficient in its management of its capital. 
 There is a lower capital requirement for securitized assets, therefore: 
 
 
 
- Northern Rock 
 intends to introduce, subject to regulatory approval, a rolling 
 share buy-back programme, to commence after the release of its 
 1999 financial results. Further details of this programme - estimated 
 at up to £150m in 2000 - will be contained in the results announcement 
 for the 1999 financial year, which is expected to be made on 26 January 
 2000. 
 
 
Mr Finn concluded: 
 "Our performance to date in the second half of this year is very encouraging. 
 For example, in terms of mortgage applications, in the second half of 
 1999 we are running 85% ahead of the same period last year. A good deal 
 of those applications will complete this year, with the rest ensuring 
 we start the New Year strongly. The early signs of success of our 
 renewal programme are already showing."
