CONNECTIONS OPTIONS
You have the option to take Connections Benefit or Connections Interest on your Save Direct Connections Account and Connections Benefit only on your Current Account.
CONNECTIONS BENEFIT
Where you opt for Connections Benefit your loan interest is only calculated on the difference between the balance of your mortgage and unsecured loans and the average monthly cleared credit balances of your connected savings account and current account. No interest is paid on your savings account balance(s), therefore there is no tax to pay on your savings.
This will result in a saving in the amount of interest charged on your together connections mortgage and, where appropriate, unsecured loan. It means you can potentially pay off your mortgage and unsecured loan early.
WHAT IF?
Imagine you had a £65,000 repayment mortgage with an initial drawdown on your unsecured loan of £18,000. Repayable over a 25 year term with an assumed rate of 6.99% until 1.1.2005, then 7.15% for the remaining term (7.4% APR). If you had a savings account with an average balance of £10,000 throughout the term of the mortgage (i.e. we would treat your borrowing as if you only owed £73,000). You would save £18,690 in interest and reduce your mortgage term by 3 years 11 months. Rate used is for illustrative purposes only. See small print.

EXAMPLE
When calculating the average balance of your savings accounts, we will consider the date funds clear.

If the above transactions were carried out on your savings account, your average balance for May would have been £63,225.81. This is calculated as follows:
£60,000 in your account for 17 days
£70,000 in your account for 6 days
£65,000 in your account for 8 days
Total = 1,020,000
= 420,000
= 520,000
= 1,960,000 
£1,960,000 is divided by the number of days in the month (31) = £63,225.81
Note: Where, in any month, the average balance of your Current Account is in debit, debit interest will be applied to your Current Account at the same rate as the mortgage and you will not receive Connections Benefit.
CONNECTIONS INTEREST
You can also opt for Connections Interest if you Connect an existing Save Direct Base Rate Tracker or new Save Direct Connections account (annual interest payment only). Where you choose this option, interest is calculated using the prevailing together connections rate and is paid annually on 22 January, subject to deduction of basic rate tax, where appropriate. You cannot opt for Connections Interest in relation to your Current Account. Remember to qualify for this interest you must have a together connections mortgage.
NOTES
You can change from Connections Benefit to Connections Interest (or vice versa) at any time, by writing to us.
Please note that you cannot opt for Connections Benefit or Connections Interest where the average monthly cleared credit balance of your savings account and/or current account exceeds the balances of your together connections mortgage and, where appropriate, unsecured loans.
If at any time the average monthly cleared credit balance in your savings/current account exceeds the balance of your together connections mortgage and, where appropriate, unsecured loans, Connections Benefit/Connections Interest will cease. We will write to you in this case.Your Save Direct Connections account will revert to a Save Direct Base Rate Tracker account and your Current Account will revert to a standard Northern Rock Current Account where interest will be paid at the prevailing rate. You will then need to contact us to reconnect your products and receive Connections Benefit or Connections Interest.

EXAMPLE
Suppose that you wish to buy a property worth £100,000 and require a 95% mortgage. In addition, you would like to set up an unsecured credit facility to make a variety of purchases in the future.
Assuming that you meet our lending criteria, the maximum loan amounts available would be calculated as follows:
Mortgage (loan secured on the property)
Property value (£100,000) multiplied by 95%
Unsecured credit facility
Property value (£100,000) multiplied by 30%
Total loan available 
= £95,000
 
= £30,000
= £125,000 
As soon as you are in a position to purchase the property (or transfer your existing mortgage), the solicitor acting for you will ask us to release the amount of the mortgage (£95,000 in our example) to allow the property purchase (or mortgage transfer) to be completed. The initial unsecured loan release, if one has been requested, will also be sent to the solicitor acting for you at this time.
Later on, suppose that you need to redecorate and furnish your home. You can simply ask us to send a sum of money from your unsecured credit facility direct to your bank account. If, for example, you needed £10,000 we would send this through the Bankers Automated Clearing Services (BACS) to your nominated bank account. The cleared funds will normally be with your bank within only 3 or 4 working days of you having asked for them.
You can ask us to release unsecured loan funds whenever you want (subject to your unsecured credit facility limit). All we ask is that each release of funds is for a minimum sum of £500.
In the above example, the monthly loan payments due would initially be calculated based upon the mortgage amount (£95,000). Following the release of the unsecured loan (£10,000), subsequent payments due would then be recalculated using the new total of released funds (£105,000). Each time that further releases are made, the payment due would be recalculated. This ensures that you are only asked to make payments based upon the amounts that you have actually borrowed.
