Choose from our limited offer Freestyle® fixed rate options.
Freestyle is much more than an ordinary mortgage because it can change with you as your needs change. So, if you’re at a stage in your life when you’d rather know exactly how much you’ll be paying on your mortgage, then a Freestyle Fixed Rate Mortgage is the option for you.
 
 You can choose from the following fixed rates
 
 
 5.85% (APR 5.3% variable) until 31/12/04 
 
 
 5.89% (APR 5.5% variable) until 15/02/07 
 
 
 5.99% (APR 5.6% variable) until 15/11/08 
 
 
 5.99% (APR 5.8% variable) until 01/03/12 
 
 
 6.49% (APR 6.8% variable) for 25 years 
 
All the above rates are for mortgages up to 90% of the value of your property. 
Visit our rates section for details of fixed rates available if your mortgage is more than 90% of the value of your property.
