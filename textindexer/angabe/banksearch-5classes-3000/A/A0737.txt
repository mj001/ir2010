Frequently asked questions about Registration
 
 
	
 
 
	
 
	
 	
	
 How do I input my One Time Password?	
	
 	
	
 Why am I getting the error "Page cannot be displayed"?	
	
 	
	
 Why can't I view the "Accept" button?	
	
 	
	
 What is the Customer Number?	
	
 	
	
 Why do my details fail validation?	
	
 	
 	
 
	
 How do I input my One Time Password?	
 
	
 Your One Time Password is a 16-digit password made up of alphabetic and numeric characters. It will be sent to you on your Internet Banking Welcome Letter. To reveal the password, peel back the password strip at the bottom right hand side of the letter.
Letters must be input as UPPERCASE, numbers are identified by an underscore.
The one time password is only used once. When the password has been entered correctly, you will be invited to change it to a password of your choice.	
 	
 
	
 Why am I getting the error "Page cannot be displayed"?	
 
	
 The most likely reason that you are getting the above errors is the security level (encryption level) on your browser software. The security level must be 128-bit encryption. To check your encryption level, please see the Technical Requirements page.	
 	
 
	
 Why can't I view the "Accept" button?	
 
	
 The problems you are experiencing may be due to the screen resolution on your PC.
To view the Accept button on the Terms and Conditions screen, try pressing the &lsquo;F11&rsquo; key on your keyboard. This should enlarge the screen to full size.
Alternatively, try pressing the tab key five times. This should highlight the &lsquo;accept&rsquo; button. By pressing enter, you should be able to proceed to the next stage.	
 	
 
	
 What is the Customer Number?	
 
	
 Your customer number is a ten digit number beginning &lsquo;30&rsquo;, which will be detailed in your 24 Hour Telephone Banking Welcome Pack. This number is specific to you. You will require this number to register for our Internet Banking service, and subsequently, each time you log on to Internet Banking.
If you have not received this number, or simply forgotten it, please contact our 24-Hour Telephone Banking Help Desk on 08457 365365.	
 	
 
	
 Why do my details fail validation?	
 
	
 It may be that you have entered incorrect details at the registration stage. Please check that you are entering the correct information as detailed below:
- Full ten-digit customer number. This can be found in your 24 Hour Telephone Banking Welcome Pack.
- Four-digit access code number. You would have chosen this number, when you initially registered for our 24-Hour Telephone Banking Service.
- Six digit sort code.
- Full eight-digit account number. This can be found on your chequebook, or autobank card.
