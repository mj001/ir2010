Because 
 we want your business, we're offering you a standard low variable rate 
 of 10.5% APR when you transfer your existing balances to us. This is 
 not an introductory offer - we'll also give you the same low rate on 
 all new purchases you make with your Northern Rock credit card.

We guarantee that 
 if you choose to, you won't need to pay any more than the minimum monthly 
 payment of 2%. This compares well to some other lenders who may charge 
 between 3% and 5%.

 You 
 could make even bigger savings each month by transferring balances from 
 other credit or store cards to your Northern Rock credit card. This costs 
 absolutely nothing and enables you to take even more advantage of our 
 low APR. We'll also provide you with credit card cheques to pay off your balances 
 on store cards or outstanding loan.

You can use your 
 Northern Rock credit card to spread the cost of living. That's because 
 you have up to 61/2 weeks interest free credit on all purchases if you 
 pay off your balance in full by the due date each month.

 Many credit card companies charge you a fee every year. 
 At Northern Rock we won't charge you an annual fee at all.

You can have either 
 VISA or MasterCard, and you can also choose from two distinct designs: 
 classic silver or a dramatic, photographic image of Holy Island, off 
 the Northumberland coast.

 Both VISA and MasterCard 
 are welcome at more than 500,000 places in the UK, and over 13 million 
 outlets world-wide. 
 You can also get instant cash from over 300,000 cash machines world-wide, 
 where you see the VISA or MasterCard signs, or over the counter at any 
 bank displaying these signs. 
 Our credit card also allows you to spread the cost of your purchases 
 over a period of time so you can pay when it suits you. 
 All you have to do to make your monthly payments is pay just 2% of your 
 outstanding balance (subject to a minimum of £5). You don't even have 
 to remember to pay your bill each month: we offer the convenience of 
 making the minimum payment by Direct Debit automatically. 
 (Direct Debit compulsory for none Northern Rock customers).

 If you lose your job 
 or you need to take time off work following an accident or sickness, then 
 our optional Payment Protection Plan can help take care of your monthly repayments 
 for up to twelve months. The Payment Protection Plan also includes lifecover. This invaluable protection costs just 69p per 
 month per £100 of outstanding balance. 
 We strongly recommend this insurance to give you complete peace of mind.

 We also strongly recommend 
 our optional Card Protection plan to protect you from fraudulent use of your cards 
 should they be lost or stolen. It covers all the cards in your household 
 and the first ninety days insurance come completely free. After that, 
 the annual fee for this cover is just £10.
