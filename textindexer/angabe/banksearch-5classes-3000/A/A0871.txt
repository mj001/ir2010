These are some other costs involved in buying a house. You must remember 
 these when you are working out how much you can afford to borrow. 
 
valuation fee 
 
Before any mortgage can be agreed we need a mortgage 
 valuation report. We can arrange this for you, using our panel 
 of qualified surveyors. You will be charged for this work. 
 
The mortgage valuation report is not a 
 survey, but it does identify obvious defects. If you wish, you can have 
 a more detailed house or flat buyers report and 
 valuation, which reports on the general condition of the property.
 
 If you want to buy a very old or unusual property, then you might want 
 to have a more comprehensive structural survey 
 done. Sometimes we need a more detailed survey in order to decide whether 
 to give you a mortgage, and we will charge you for the work involved. In any event you may wish to obtain a structural survey in respect of your property as it will provide you with more detailed information about the property and any potential problems which may be faced.
 
 legal fees 
 
The legal work transfers the ownership of a property from one person 
 to another. It is called conveyancing, and is usually done by a solicitor. 
 This can be one of the biggest costs involved in buying a house.
 
 Most solicitors charge according to how much the property is worth. 
 You should always get a quote before you instruct a solicitor. 
 
There are other legal fees that you'll have to pay to do with preparing 
 the documentation that provides us with security over the property (called 
 a legal charge in England, a standard 
 security in Scotland, and a mortgage 
 in Northern Ireland), and any other security required. 
 
We will try and use the same solicitor as you used for conveyancing in 
 order to minimise the cost.
 
 stamp duty 
 
This is a government tax applied when you buy a property for £60,001 
 or more. 
 
 
 
 
YOUR HOME IS AT RISK IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS 
 ON A MORTGAGE OR OTHER LOAN SECURED ON IT.
