Story
 
You are an expert Money Maker. Your mission is to accumulate savings in your Yorkshire Bank Cybersave Account 
 and keep your money out of the clutches of your enemies who want to drain your cash, like the Cash-Eating-Sofa 
 and the Greedy Piggy Bank. To keep your levels high you need to bank all your bonuses, like pocket money and 
 Saturday job wages.
 
By banking your money and keeping it safe, you can build up your savings into a tidy lump sum. Remember, the 
 more you have in your account the more interest you earn on your money.
 
The aim of the game is to save up for the big things you really want. And remember, this isn’t a game. This is real life.
