With Business Saver you can have penalty free access to your money. All we ask is that you make no more than 12 withdrawals in each calendar year. 
 
And with the annual interest rate guaranteed to be no lower than 1% below the UK Base Rate* until January 2003 it's a great investment opportunity. 
You can choose to have your interest paid annually or monthly (we'll keep you up to date with a statement). 
And you have the convenience of an account that's operated by first class post. 
So invest now with £10,000 or more. 
*By UK Base Rate we mean The Bank of England's official dealing rate (the repo rate) as set by the Monetary Policy Committee.

 With Business Saver, your interest is calculated daily and paid either annually or monthly. Companies can have their interest paid gross. For all other businesses interest will be paid after deduction of tax at the prevailing rate (currently 20%). 
Annual interest can be added to your Business Saver account, or paid into another account. This is normally done on the first bank working day following 31st January. 
Monthly interest can be paid into another account, normally on the first bank working day of each month. Monthly interest cannot be added to your account.
