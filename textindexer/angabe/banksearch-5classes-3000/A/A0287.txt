Bank of Ireland to invest Stg£6 million in Belfast
 
Wednesday 6th February 2002	
 
Bank of Ireland, Northern Ireland today announced a £6m investment in Belfast city centre, including the creation of a flagship branch designed to set new standards in financial services for personal and business users.
 
Unveiling the plans, David McGowan (Chief Executive, Northern Ireland) said the new city branch would open at the junction of Castle Place/High Street in the summer.The new branch combines the services provided by the three existing outlets which lie within minutes of each other at Donegall Place, Royal Avenue and High Street.
David said: "The three current branches each have drawbacks that prevent us from developing the quality of city centre branch that our customers deserve. We have chosen a building and a location that allows us to create the most advanced branch outlet in the city by designing it from the customer's point of view. 
"The branch will have more staff available to serve customers than the existing three branches combined. This means we can have state-of-the-art facilities comparable to, if not better than, any branch in the British Isles, while at the same time giving the level of personal service that customers of this bank have come to expect."
The design of the city branch will enable customers to make a quick and easy choice about the level of service they want - from a self-service and e-banking area with multi-currency ATMs at the front of the branch through to meetings with the same friendly staff and financial service advisers.
The lobby will include a franchised coffee bar, adding to the modern, less formal style of the branch.
David added: "Northern Ireland is a strong and successful market for Bank of Ireland Group and we are delighted to be able to make an investment in Belfast which brings a new focus to our business."
"We will have one flagship branch concentrating on retail financial services as well as our Donegall House offices opposite the City Hall which service the important Corporate and Business banking markets. We plan to retain the Donegall Place offices for administration, with a convenient ground floor self-service and e-banking lobby.
He said the investment was part of Bank of Ireland's strategy of maintaining and improving its branch services throughout Northern Ireland while further developing telephone and internet banking through Banking 365 for personal customers and the Business On Line service.
Bank of Ireland has also recently completed a new branch at University Road in Belfast at a cost of £1.25m to replace its old University branch nearby.
