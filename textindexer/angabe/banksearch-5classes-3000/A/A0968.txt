Case studies 
Financing green projects 
 
Our Environmental Loan Support Scheme helps 
 small and medium-sized businesses finance projects offering 
 environmental benefit. Wigan-based Eatwell UK used a loan 
 granted under the scheme to finance the installation of new 
 insulation and refrigeration as part of a new environmentally 
 friendly food-processing facility.
 Contributing to sustainable mining
 
As a provider of project and corporate finance 
 to the global mining sector, Barclays takes a keen interest 
 in the industry's efforts to improve its corporate social 
 responsibility. We participate in the Mining Minerals and 
 Sustainable Development Project, which brings together individuals, 
 non-governmental organisations,institutions and companies 
 to address critical issues facing the sector. As financiers, 
 we use the World Bank's environmental guidelines both as minimum 
 criteria for lending decisions to the industry and for ongoing 
 loan performance monitoring.
