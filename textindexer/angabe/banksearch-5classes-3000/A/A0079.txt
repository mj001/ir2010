CH - Cheque Deposited £ - Available for Withdrawal INT - Interest earned from this
day.
Availability of funds and interest earning dates are based on English bank working days
which are days of the week excluding Saturdays, Sundays and English public holidays. The
fact that funds are available for withdrawal does not mean that the item has cleared.
If a cheque is returned unpaid, we will debit that amount, and any interest we have paid
on it, to that Account.
If you pay in cash (notes only) at an Abbey National cash machine the money will be
available for withdrawal on the second working day after the day it is paid in. Interest
will be earned from the next working day after the day the cash is paid in.
