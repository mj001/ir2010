 If you hold investments dealing in stocks and 
 shares, unit and investment trusts, a Citibank 
 Sharedealing Account from Stocktrade will help 
 you manage and organise them. It's a simple, inexpensive 
 way to invest in the stockmarket. 
 
How does it work? 
 
Your investments are held on your behalf in a 
 nominee account. With the introduction of CREST 
 and the move away from paper certificates, nominee 
 accounts really are the future of private investing. 
 By cutting down on paperwork and administration, 
 a Citibank Sharedealing Account offers one of 
 the most efficient and cost effective ways to 
 invest, making the whole process easier, more 
 enjoyable, and ultimately more profitable. 
 
All shares purchased through your account will 
 be registered in the name of New Town Nominees 
 Ltd (Stocktrade's pooled service company) or held 
 in a Euroclear account or with Stocktrade's agent 
 abroad. Of course you still remain the beneficial 
 owner. 
 
If you have other shares in your own name, either 
 in paper form or in another nominee company, you 
 can transfer them, free of charge, to your Stocktrade 
 account. 
 
The service is available for UK or foreign stocks, 
 but dealing and settlement will always take place 
 in Sterling. 
 
How do you use it? 
 
Once your account is up and running all you have 
 to do is contact the Citibank Sharedealing service 
 with your instructions and leave the rest to Stocktrade. 
 We'll send you free quarterly valuations and statements 
 itemising all your dealing transactions, as well 
 as a consolidated tax certificate which you just 
 attach to your tax return. 
 
You should receive settlement for stock exchange 
 dealings in UK stocks 5 business days after transaction. 
 All purchases and sales will be settled direct 
 to and from your Citibank Sterling Current Account. 
 Which is why you need to have an account before 
 you can make use of the service. 
 
All the information you need to make informed 
 decisions 
 
The Citibank Sharedealing service puts you in 
 control. You'll find all the information you need 
 on the Citibank website, such as up-to-the-minute 
 reports and analysis, and access to research information 
 from Reuters which you'll find invaluable when 
 making purchasing decisions.

'Best' and 'limit' price 
 
We'll carry out your instructions as soon as 
 possible during dealing hours (9am - 4.30pm 
 Monday - Friday). You can ask us to obtain 
 the best price available at the time of your deal, 
 or for UK stocks you can set a 'limit' price. 
 This will be held open until the close of business 
 that day.
