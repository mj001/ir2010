HomeMortgagesRegular Bonus 
Choose Capital Reward to receive regular bonuses.
A bank that wants to help you pay off your mortgage? We realise it’s not what you’d normally expect, but that’s exactly what we’re doing with our Capital Reward Mortgage.
We pay 1% off your mortgage every two years.
How it works
We will pay you a Capital Reduction Bonus of 1% every two years which will reduce the outstanding capital balance of your mortgage. Because the bonus reduces the capital you have borrowed, your interest payments go down too - and you’ll have a smaller mortgage to clear at the and of your term.
Rates
Our Capital Reward Mortgage variable rate is extremely competitive from just 5.00% (typical APR 4.7% variable). 
How much you can save
You could receive a total bonus of £6,953 on a £90,000 interest only mortgage, with 16 years remaining. For full details of this example, please click here.
Just take a look at the range of features and benefits a Capital Reward Mortgage can offer:
- Help with fees
We’ll pay your standard valuation fee on completion
We’ll contribute up to £200 towards your legal fees on completion
There’s no Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee premium to pay
- Overpayments
You can make regular or lump sum overpayments which can significantly reduce the term of your mortgage and the interest you have to pay.
Each time you receive your bonus, you could decide to continue paying the same monthly amount you’ve always paid. In effect, this means you’re making overpayments on your mortgage - but at no additional cost to you.
- Repayment options
You can borrow up to 95% of the property’s value and can choose to have an interest only mortgage, repayment or a combination of both.
- Payment holidays
When finances are tight, you can take up to two mortgage payment holidays per year, subject to our terms and conditions.
	
- Daily interest calculation
Interest is calculated daily - allowing immediate benefit from each repayment
