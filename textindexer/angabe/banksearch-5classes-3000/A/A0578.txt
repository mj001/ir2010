Getting to grips with the basics
Buying your first home is an exciting experience - a chance to spread your wings, have a place of your own and make plans for the future. But with so many options and choices it can be a rather
daunting prospect. So how can we help you navigate the path to homeownership without tripping up?
The best place to start is with a clear understanding of the basics - which is why we’ve put together this simple guide. It won ’t turn you into a mortgage expert (that ’s our job!), but it will give you the confidence you need to ask the right questions, and make the right decisions.
We’ve tried to keep everything clear and straightforward, but some jargon goes with the territory. So, if you find a word you don’t understand, check out our jargon buster: you should find a clear explanation there.
Remember, our mortgage specialists are always on hand to help.
When you’re ready, simply make an appointment at your local
branch and we’ll go through your options with you. Alternatively,
you can phone us on 0845 300 8000 † (8.30am - 6.00pm Monday
to Friday,10.00am -1.00pm Saturday), or email us at direct.mortgages@bristol-west.co.uk
