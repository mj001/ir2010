WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 
 Our basic Buy to Let lending criteria 
 
 
- Our Buy to Let mortgages are for private individuals only. Up to four people, 
 can make joint applications. 
 
- They are available to both new and existing Northern Rock customers. 
 
- All applicants must be at least 21 years old. 
 
- Mortgages are available up to a maximum of 75% of the property's value. 
 
- The minimum value of the property you're buying must be £40,000 and 
 the maximum loan per property £250,000. We'll lend on up to four properties 
 (and up to a total value of £1million). Please talk to our Commercial 
 Finance Department if you want to buy more than four properties or purchase 
 a property worth over £250,000. 
 
- As a borrower intending to rent out your property, you must have an Assured 
 Shorthold Tenancy Agreement for each property. 
 
- You should also consider the office of Fair Trading Guidance on 
 unfair terms in Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreements before you finalise your 
 agreement. 
 Your income and the rent you charge 
 The rental income from the property must be equal to or greater than your 
 monthly mortgage repayment*. Please note that whichever mortgage option you 
 choose, we'll make this calculation based on a capital and interest basis over 
 a 25 year term at a nominal interest rate of 8.00%. You'll also need to have 
 a minimum annual income of £25,000 (excluding your rental income). 
 
*There is no guarantee that it will be possible to arrange continuous letting of the property nor that the rental income will be sufficient to meet the cost of the mortgage.
If these products are inapropriate for your needs, you may like to consider our range of Commercial Mortgages.
YOUR HOME IS AT RISK IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON A MORTGAGE OR OTHER LOAN SECURED ON IT.
