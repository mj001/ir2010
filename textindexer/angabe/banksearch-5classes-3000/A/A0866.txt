Travellers cheques
 	
 	
 	 
 	Travellers cheques purchased from HSBC can be cashed commission-free at any bank in the HSBC Group with counter facilities. 
 	
 	
 	 
 	Can often be used as cash in shops, hotels and restaurants, especially in the USA. 
 	
 	
 	 
 	Available in 9 major currencies. If lost or stolen, they can be replaced (usually in 24 hours). 
 	
 	
 	 
 	Travellers cheques are available in large and small denominations, allowing you to plan holiday spending on a day-by-day basis. 
 	
 	
 	 
 	
 	 
 	 
 	 
 	 
 	
 	 
 	 
 	 
 	
Foreign currency
 	
 	
 	 
 	Always take a small amount of foreign currency with you for your immediate spending needs on arrival e.g. taxis etc. 
 	
 	 	
 	 
 	A wide range of currencies are available immediately at our branches with bureaux de change. 
 	
 	
 	 
 	At other branches, allow three working days before travel. 
 	
 	
 	 
 	
	 	 
 	 
 	 
 	 
 	
 	 
 	 
 	 
 	
When you return from your holiday we will buy back leftover travellers cheques, if purchased from our branches, free of charge. There is a small commission fee for foreign bank notes.
