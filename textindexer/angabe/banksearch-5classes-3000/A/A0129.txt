Definitions
 *Gross - Gross interest is interest payable without taking account of the deduction of income
 tax. For most customers tax will be deducted at the lower rate prevailing at the time of payment (presently
 20%)
 
++AER - stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and 
 illustrates what the rate would be if interest was paid and compounded 
 each year. 
 
+EAR (Effective Annual Rate) - The effective annual rate is used to express the cost of borrowing
 on current accounts. The EAR takes account of the rate of interest charged, the frequency it is levied to accounts
 and compounding of interest. It does not include overdraft fees.
