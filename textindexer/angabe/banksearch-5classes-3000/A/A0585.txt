	Hoares bank was founded in 1672 by Richard Hoare at the sign of the Golden Bottle in Cheapside, London.
	
	In 1690 he moved the business to new premises in Fleet Street, still within the City of London. He continued trading at the sign of the Golden Bottle (a gilded leather bottle that hung outside the shop). Street numbering was unknown in those days and signs were used to distinguish one business from another.
	
	C. Hoare & Co. is the sole survivor of the private deposit banks which were established in the 17th and 18th centuries. As such it has a long and interesting history.
