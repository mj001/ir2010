- cancel or suspend the right to use any Card, or PIN, or Credit 
 Card Cheque entirely or in respect of specific functions or transactions;

 We will not be liable to You or any Additional Cardholder for 
 any loss or damage arising as a result of Us exercising Our 
 rights in accordance with this Condition. 
 
4. Your Account
 
 4.1 We will debit to Your Account the amount of each Purchase 
 and of each Advance. We may be contacted by a retailer or 
 a person acting on its or the retailer's behalf to confirm that 
 it will authorise a proposed Purchase or Advance. Purchases or Advances 
 which are authorised are treated as having been debited to the Account 
 on the date of authorisation and will immediately reduce the credit 
 available on the Account by the amount of the Purchase or Advance. 
 
 
5. Foreign Currency Transactions 
 
5.1 The amount of any Purchase or Advance in a currency other than 
 Sterling will be converted into Sterling at a rate of exchange determined 
 by the Schemes. In addition, the rate of exchange shown on Your Statement 
 will include an administration levy of 2.75% as explained in Condition 
 7.2. 
 
6. Payment 
 
	 6.1 Repayment will take place when repayments are credited to Your 
 Account and will be applied in the following order:
 
	
- in payment of all interest, annual fee (where applicable), administration 
 	charges and handling charges shown on any Statement;
 	
- towards repayment of all Advances shown on any Statement;
 
	 	
- towards repayment of all Purchases shown on any Statement; 
 	
- towards repayment of any Advance made but not then shown on 
 	any Statement; and 
 	
- towards repayment of any Purchases made but not then shown on 
 	any Statement.
	
	
 
6.2 From time to time, We may notify You of Special Promotions 
 which may include a reduced rate of interest or special terms 
 We may offer for particular transactions or categories of transaction. 
 On these occasions, repayments will be applied towards repayment 
 of Special Promotion Advances and Purchases before the repayments 
 shown in Condition 6.1 (ii) to (v), but in the same order for Advances 
 and Purchases.
 
 6.3 We will send a Statement of Your Account ('Statement') 
 to You each month, except where there has been no movement on the 
 Account during the period to which the Statement relates and the 
 balance of the Account is nil. The Statement will detail the minimum 
 sum You must repay and the date by which such repayment must reach 
 the Account. The minimum sum will be the greater of £5 or 5% of 
 the outstanding balance. Where the outstanding balance is less than 
 £5, the minimum sum will be the whole of the outstanding balance. 
 If You wish to query any item on any Statement, You must contact 
 Us immediately. 
 
6.4 We may give You the opportunity from time to time to 
 take a Payment Holiday. During Payment Holidays, We will continue 
 to work out and charge interest under Condition 7. The Payment Holiday 
 will not extend the period referred to in Condition 7.1 during which 
 You must repay the outstanding balance in full to avoid paying interest. 
 
 
7. Interest 
 
7.1 With the exception of interest on Credit Card Cheques and Balance 
 Transfers, no interest will be charged on any amount debited to 
 Your Account in respect of Purchases or Advances if the whole of 
 the outstanding balance on a Statement is paid in full and credited 
 to the Account within 25 days of the Statement date. If the full 
 balance is not repaid within the 25 day period, interest is charged 
 at a daily rate on the full balance from the date each Purchase 
 or Advance was debited to the Account until full repayment is credited 
 to the Account. Interest on Credit Card Cheque and Balance Transfer 
 transactions will be charged at a daily rate from the date the transaction 
 was debited until full repayment is made. Interest will be charged 
 each month and calculated on a daily basis. 
 
7.2 In calculating the APR, no account has been taken of 
 Our right to vary the interest rate, handling charge or annual 
 fee, which together with the administration levy may be varied on 
 notice to You with Your Statement, or otherwise in writing, by way 
 of notice at our branches and/or advertisement in the national press. 
 On receipt of such notification, You may terminate the Agreement 
 by serving notice in accordance with Condition 16.1. A handling 
 charge of 1.5% (minimum charge £2.00) is payable on each Advance 
 (with the exception of a Balance Transfer for which no handling 
 charge is made) and the APR for Advances (apart from Balance 
 Transfers) will include the handling charge. In addition, in respect 
 of all foreign currency transactions there is an administration 
 levy equivalent to 2.75% of the transaction value.

 destroyed by cutting off the right hand corner and the Credit Card

	in technology and, We believe, will be in line with Your expectations. Where We believe the 
	changes may not be obvious to You, We will give You notice of them.
	When You sign an application form for a product or service, You are agreeing that by continuing 
	to maintain Your Account, product or service for at least 60 days after We have notified You of

	information held at credit reference agencies, the applicant will receive the name(s) of any 
	associate(s), but only information relating to him/herself.

	obtain credit.

 security for Our customers and staff and in order to maintain and improve 
 Our service.

 YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL 
 
Once you have signed, you will have for a short time a right to 
 cancel this Agreement. You can do this by sending or taking a WRITTEN 
 notice of cancellation to: Ulster Bank, Card Products Department, 
 11/16 Donegall Square East, Belfast BT1 5UB.
 If You cancel the Agreement, any money you have paid, goods given 
 in part exchange (or their value) and property given as security 
 must be returned to you. You will still have to repay any money 
 lent to You. But if You repay all of it before Your first instalment 
 is due - or, if you are not paying by instalments, within one month 
 after cancellation - You will not have to pay interest or other 
 charges. Any goods which you already have under the Agreement, apart 
 from any purchased out of a cash loan, will have to be returned. 
 Such goods should not be used and should be kept safe. (Legal action 
 may be taken against you if you do not take proper care of them.) 
 You can wait for them to be collected from you and you need not 
 hand them over unless you receive a written request. If you wish, 
 however, You may return the goods yourself. You will not, however, 
 be required to hand back any goods supplied to meet an emergency, 
 or which have already been incorporated, for example, in Your home. 
 But you will still be liable to pay for emergency goods or services 
 or for any goods which have been incorporated by You or one of Your 
 relatives. 
	
 
IMPORTANT - YOU SHOULD READ THIS CAREFULLY
 YOUR RIGHTS
 
 The Consumer Credit Act 1974 covers this Agreement and lays down 
 certain requirements for your protection which must be satisfied 
 when the Agreement is made. If they are not, the Bank cannot enforce 
 the Agreement against you without a court order.
 
 The Act also gives you a number of rights. You have the right to 
 settle this Agreement at any time by giving notice in writing and 
 paying off all amounts payable under the agreement. If you have 
 obtained unsatisfactory goods or services under a transaction financed 
 by this Agreement, apart from any purchased out of a cash loan, 
 you may have a right to sue the supplier, the Bank or both. Similarly, 
 if the contract is not fulfilled, perhaps because the supplier has 
 gone out of business, you may still be able to sue the Bank. If 
 you would like to know more about the protection and remedies provided 
 under the Act, you should contact either your local Trading Standards 
 Department or your nearest Citizens' Advice Bureau. 
 
LOSS OR MISUSE OF CARD 
 
If the Card is lost, stolen or misused by someone who obtained

	CREDIT CARD REPAYMENT PROTECTOR
 WHO CAN HAVE IT?
	
 
 Your acceptance is assured, provided You are:
 
- the principal cardholder between the age of majority and 64 years, 
 
 
- permanently living and working in the UK, Channel Islands or the 
 Isle of Man and, 
 
- have been in permanent paid employment, including self-employment, 
 of at least 16 hours per week for the past six months. 
 Credit Card Repayment Protector cover automatically ceases at age 
 65.
 Fixed-term contract workers are eligible for cover but, in the 
 event of an unemployment claim, the exclusion in the "What is not 
 covered?" section relating to fixed-term contracts may apply.
 If You are self-employed, You can only claim unemployment benefit if 
 You involuntarily cease trading due to the financial insolvency of 
 Your business.
 If You are in temporary work, You cannot be covered 
 under this insurance.
 Any change in Your employment status may affect 
 Your entitlement to claim. 
 
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? 
 
The cover costs 77p for every £100 shown on Your statement balance. 
 A minimum charge of 15p will be made for outstanding monthly balances 
 of less than £20. No charge will be made if your balance is nil. Premiums 
	are applied automatically and charged 
 to Your Credit Card Account each month. The premiums quoted are 
 correct at time of issue and include Insurance Premium Tax at the 
 appropriate rate. The rate of this tax may be liable to change. 
 
 
HOW CREDIT CARD REPAYMENT PROTECTOR WORKS
 
 
- If You are unable to work due to an accident or sickness, or 
 if You become registered unemployed involuntarily, this insurance 
 can repay 10% of the outstanding balance on the last statement before 
 You became ill or were first advised You were to become unemployed.
 
- Payments continue for each subsequent full month of continuous 
 disability or unemployment. Any two periods of disability or unemployment 
 will be treated as one claim if there are less than three consecutive 
 months of employment between them, providing that for disability 
 claims the disability arises from the same cause. Should a claim 
 change from disability to unemployment or vice versa, it will also 
 be treated as one claim. You cannot claim for disability and unemployment 
 at the same time. A maximum of twelve months' payments will be made 
 for any one claim and once this has been received You will not be 
 able to claim again until You have returned to employment for a 
 continuous period of at least six months. 
 
- If You die, the outstanding balance on the last statement before 
 Your death will be cleared in full. 
 
- Under present UK legislation, all benefits payable are free of taxation
 with the exception of any benefit payable if You die which may be subject 
 to inheritance tax. This situation may be liable to change. 
 
- There is a maximum limit of £7,500 for death cover and £750 per 
 month for any disability or unemployment claim. 
 
WHAT IS NOT COVERED?
 
Insurers will not be liable for periods of disability:
 
	 
- of less than 14 consecutive days;
 
- resulting from any medical condition for which treatment has been 
 	given or diagnosis had been made or investigations commencing during
 	12 months immediately before Your commencement date;
 	
- resulting from Your wilful action, deliberate actions, drug addiction or drug
 	dependence or taking alcohol or drugs, except under a Doctors direction
 	(unless that direction relates to the treatment of drug addiction or
 	dependence).
