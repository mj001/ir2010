 How diversification can help 
 
In today's complex financial markets investors 
 have an almost unlimited choice but each investment 
 carries its own specific potential return and 
 risk making it important to select wisely. However, 
 you might be able to cut the risk and increase 
 your chances of meeting your investment goals 
 by using asset allocation. This is an approach 
 enables you to diversify your portfolio according 
 to a plan that suits you.

 What is Asset Allocation?
 You can use asset allocation to weight 
 a range of investments in your portfolio to try 
 to meet a specific investment objective. For instance, 
 if you've weighed up the risks and your goal is 
 to pursue growth, you may decide to place 20% 
 of your assets in bonds and 80% in shares. The 
 asset classes you choose, and how you weight your 
 investment in each, will probably hinge on your 
 investment time frame and how that can best be 
 matched with the risks and rewards of each asset 
 class.

 Shares, Bonds and Money 
 Markets 
 
Here's a closer look at the risk and reward levels 
 of the major asset classes: 
 
Shares - Well known for fluctuating frequently 
 in value, shares carry a high level of market 
 risk - the risk that the value of your investments 
 will decrease with any fall in the stock markets. 
 Historically however, shares have earned much 
 higher returns than other asset classes. There 
 are no guarantees that shares will continue to 
 outpace inflation but you may be advised to consider 
 their potential. 
 
 Bonds - In general, these securities 
 have less severe short-term price fluctuations 
 than shares and therefore offer lower market risk. 
 Government bonds are felt to be safer than those 
 offered by companies as the investor must bear 
 the risk of defaults. 
 
 Money market instruments - Among the 
 most stable of all asset classes in terms of returns, 
 money market instruments carry very low market 
 risk. At the same time, these securities don't 
 have the potential to outpace inflation through 
 the years by as wide a margin as shares.

 Diversification: The 
 Base of Asset Allocation 
 
Diversification through asset allocation helps 
 reduce risk of equities through investing in several 
 different types of individual funds or securities. 
 It also cuts risk by using various different bond 
 investments combined with a balancing exposure 
 to cash deposits.
 When you diversify your investments among more 
 than one security, you help reduce what is known 
 as "single-security risk," or the risk that your 
 investment will fluctuate widely in value with 
 the price of one holding. Diversifying among several 
 asset classes increases the chance that, if and 
 when the return of one investment is falling, 
 the return of another in your portfolio may be 
 rising.
 In 1999, shares returned 16%, compared with 0% 
 for gilts.* Equities generally did less well in 
 2000 and this illustrates that past performance 
 cannot guarantee future results.

 Asset allocation will 
 change with lifestyle 
 
Generally, your asset allocation will change 
 as you reach different stages in your life, and 
 your investment goals change along with these 
 shifts in lifestyle. If you have been investing 
 aggressively for retirement for more than 20 years 
 and are now less than 10 years from retiring, 
 protecting any gains from market ups and downs 
 may become more important. In this case you may 
 want to shift some of your share allocation gradually 
 into your bond and money market holdings. 
 However at the age of 25 you may decide to invest 
 with the goal of retiring in comfort within 40 
 years. Your investment goal is probably to achieve 
 as much growth as possible - growth that will 
 substantially outpace inflation. In aiming for 
 this goal, you may allocate 70% of your assets 
 to aggressive growth shares, 20% to bonds and 
 10% to money market instruments. You have years 
 to ride out the fluctuations that come with share 
 investment but, at the same time, you still potentially 
 lower your risk with your bond and money market 
 holdings. 
 Because your goals and circumstances are unique, 
 you may want to talk to an investment adviser 
 who can help you tailor an allocation strategy 
 to your individual needs.

 A key to long-term investment 
 success
 
Asset allocation is a simple concept, yet it 
 can be vital to long-term investment success. 
 For many individual investors, asset allocation 
 decision amount to choosing what types of unit 
 trusts or mutual funds to invest in, and the amount 
 to invest in each type. Others may want to add 
 individual securities to this mix after exploring 
 their investment options. Regardless of the asset 
 allocation strategy you choose and the investments 
 you select, keep in mind that a well-crafted plan 
 of action over the long term can help you weather 
 all sorts of changing market conditions as you 
 aim to meet your investment goals.

 Points to remember 
 
 
- Asset allocation is used to spread your investments 
 among different asset classes, such as shares 
 and equity unit trusts and bonds. 
 
- When prices of different types of assets 
 do not move in tandem, combining these investments 
 in a portfolio can help reduce the variability 
 of returns, commonly referred to as "market 
 risk." 
 
- Unit trusts are pools of securities, usually 
 offering diversification within a single asset 
 class. Some mutual funds may include several 
 asset classes. 
 
- The asset allocation that is right for you 
 will depend on your investment time frame, goals 
 and how much risk you are prepared to accept. 
 
 
- As your investment time frame and goals change, 
 so might your asset allocation. Many financial 
 experts suggest re-evaluating your asset allocation 
 periodically or whenever you pass a major milestone 
 in your life such as marriage, the birth of 
 a child or retirement.
