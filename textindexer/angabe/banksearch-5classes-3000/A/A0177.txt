Freestyle Fixed - fixed rate options for easy planning.
Ever since we launched Freestyle Mortgages, we've been providing our 
customers with outstanding value, service and flexibility. After all, we wanted 
to create a range of mortgages which would give our customers choice while still 
offering them a better deal all round.
Freestyle is all about choice. It's about selecting the options that are right 
for you now - and being able to adapt them at any time in the future.
Many of the questions commonly asked about our mortgages apply to all of the different 
options in the Freestyle range. Here's a selection of things you'll need to know 
regardless of which choices you're planning to make.
 
 
- How much can I borrow?
- Can I mix fixed and variable rates?
- Do I have options on how I can repay?
- How long can I take to repay?
- What about security?
- Can I borrow more money in the future?
- How are repayments made?
- Will I get regular statements?
- Can my Freestyle Mortgage move with me when I move house?
- Can I make overpayments on my Freestyle Mortgage?
- Can I take a payment holiday?
- Are there any charges with my Freestyle Mortgage?
- What happens when a fixed rate or a discounted period finishes?
- What insurance cover will I need to have?
- How do I apply?
 
How much can I borrow?
Minimum £25,001 (except 25 year fixed rate which has a minimum loan of £75,000). 
Max £750,000 for up to 75% of the value of the property to be mortgaged. 
Max £500,000 for up to 80% of the value of the property to be mortgaged. 
Max £400,000 for up to 90% of the value of the property to be mortgaged. 
Max £250,000 for 90.01 - 95% of the value of the property to be mortgaged. 
All loans are based on affordability.

Can I mix fixed and variable rates?
Yes. For example, you could have a portion of your mortgage at a variable rate (which would be discounted for the initial period) while the rest could be fixed (subject to availability).

Do I have options on how I can repay?
You can pay interest only - which means that you will have to run a suitable investment plan alongside your mortgage (such as an endowment policy or other long term investment) which will then clear the capital sum borrowed at the end 
of the mortgage term. 
Alternatively, you can pay capital and interest where each monthly payment covers both the interest due and part of the capital, reducing your outstanding loan each month. You can also split your mortgage so that a portion is paid interest only while the remainder is capital and interest.
Please note, the 25 year fixed rate mortgage is capital and interest only.

How long can I take to repay?
It's up to you to decide how long you want to take to repay your mortgage. 
The minimum period is the fixed term and the mortgage must be repaid by the 
time you are 65 (or 67 for the 25 year fixed rate). The less time you take, the higher your monthly repayments will be. You should note that you can make overpayments on the variable rate portion of a Freestyle Mortgage at any time. You can even have different portions of the mortgage over different periods.

What about security?
Standard Life Bank will take first legal charge over the mortgaged property which must be located in the UK. All properties must be surveyed by arrangement with Standard Life Bank approved valuers. At a minimum, we require to see a standard valuation report.

Can I borrow more money in the future?
Again, the answer is yes. As long as the amount you borrow remains at 90% or less of the value of your home for a maximum loan of £400,000, 80% or less for a maximum loan of £500,000 or 75% or less for a maximum loan of £750,000, you can have access to your Cash Reserve. As long as you can afford the repayments, your Cash Reserve can be used to buy anything you want and you may want to consider using it in much the same way as you would a personal loan or other high value finance package. 
You can pay back any amount borrowed from your Cash Reserve over the term that 
suits you. Best of all, you're borrowing at Freestyle Mortgage rates which can mean a considerable saving when compared with other forms of finance. 
Even if you borrow the full 95% at the start of your Freestyle Mortgage, you may qualify for Cash Reserve in the future. Simply contact us for more details at the time. 
You can borrow any amount from £1,000 to the maximum of your Cash Reserve and pay it back over the term that suits you as long as it's repaid by the end of your mortgage term or by the time you are 65 (or 67 for the 25 year fixed rate), whichever is sooner.

How are repayments made?
Monthly payments are made by Direct Debit. You can choose the day in the month which suits you and you can change it at any time.

Will I get regular statements?
Mortgage statements are sent out every six months and will detail the transactions and outstanding balances of your mortgage accounts. They will also show, if applicable, how much Cash Reserve remains available to you. You can also request an interim statement at any time. Please note, however, that this will not detail how much 
is available in your Cash Reserve.
 
Back to top    
 
Can my Freestyle Mortgage move with me when I move house?
Yes. Your mortgage can move with you and, if you have a discounted variable rate element to your mortgage, a further discount will be available if you move house. If you require additional funding, we'll be happy to consider your application for further funds. Just call us when you're ready. 
 
Back to top    
 
Can I make overpayments on my Freestyle Mortgage?
Yes. You can make overpayments either regularly or as a lump sum on any variable rate portion of your mortgage. The effect of overpayments also applies immediately because we calculate interest daily. This can reduce the term of your mortgage and save you money in interest. Any overpayments you make also go into your Cash Reserve and can be borrowed back whenever you want.
 
Back to top    
 
Can I take a payment holiday?
Once you've made six consecutive payments you can take up to two payment holidays a year (subject to available reserve and ability to pay). To arrange a payment holiday, just call us 22 days in advance of when you want to miss your payment.

Are there any charges with my Freestyle Mortgage?
There are no hidden charges and you will benefit from:
	
- No Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee premium
	
- Standard valuation fee refunded on completion
	
- Contribution of up to £200 towards legal fees on completion
	
- No mortgage arrangement fee for variable rate mortgages
	
Please refer to our tariff of charges for further information.

What happens when a fixed rate or a discounted period finishes?
When a fixed rate or a discounted rate period finishes, the rate will automatically revert to the appropriate standard variable rate and we'll write to tell you how much your payments will be. At this point you could opt for a fixed rate, subject 
to availability and an arrangement fee.
Back to top    
 
What insurance cover will I need to have?
You must take out buildings insurance before we release your mortgage funds and it must remain in place throughout the term of your mortgage. While you can choose any insurance company, you'll find that Standard Life Bank's own Home Insurance has been developed to meet all your needs for comprehensive buildings and contents cover at a very competitive price.

Life Assurance
We also recommend that you have adequate life assurance cover linked to your mortgage. Standard Life can organise this cover for you if you wish.
