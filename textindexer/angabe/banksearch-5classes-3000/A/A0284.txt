At Abbey National we are committed to keeping your personal information secure & confidential both on-line and offline. We want you to enjoy your interaction with our website and its associated services, whether you are looking for information, using our on-line transactional services or applying for an account.
Sources of information
Whilst browsing and interacting with this website, there are several ways in which we can capture information generated by your actions, either directly or indirectly. These sources are explained in the "Browsing the 'freely accessible' areas of the website" and the "Browsing the encrypted (secure) areas of the website" sections and we have detailed how and why we capture this information and subsequently what we do with it.
Protecting yourself on-line
Below are some of the things that you can do to protect the security of your personal information on-line. The list is not exhaustive but by following these suggestions you should not fall foul of internet fraud.
- You should never disclose your logon credentials to anyone, not even to a person with whom you access a joint account on-line or an Abbey National employee. We may however ask you to confirm certain digits from your credentials to identify you when you contact us in other ways.
- Don't send account details/personal details via Internet e-mail. There is a risk that your e-mail could be intercepted en route.
- When logged into an on-line service, don't leave your PC unattended (for your safety you are automatically logged off after 10 minutes).
- Close your browser session once you have logged off.
- When accessing your accounts or applying on-line, be aware of other people around you, e.g. in public places such as Internet cafes.

e-banking service 
Our e-banking service operates from secure systems within Abbey National and because you are accessing your accounts remotely we have added extra layers of security for your added peace of mind.
Prior to entering your logon credentials we take you to a secure part of our computer system. Subsequent messages sent to and from this system are protected by 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. We recommend that you update your browser's cipher strength to 128-bit SSL. This should prevent any problems caused when viewing secure sites. If you have any questions about this please contact our technical support line on 0845 600 4388, which is open from 7am until 11pm, seven days a week.
In order to access your accounts we require 3 pieces of information from you to verify that you are authorised to view the account details. Firstly your card number is required, secondly a passcode is needed and finally a registration number. Only once all three parts of the data are confirmed as being correctly entered will we allow access to the accounts system.
In addition, we have introduced a 'Peace of Mind Guarantee'. When using the Abbey National On-line Services we will cover any losses from fraud - guaranteed. Just as long as you have taken the necessary safeguards to keep your passcode and registration number secret and haven't deliberately involved yourself in fraud. 
All our on-line transactional services are protected by 'firewalls'. This technology monitors & prevents any unauthorised access to our back-end systems ensuring that all your account/personal details cannot be accessed by 'hackers'.
e-mortgage service
Our e-mortgage service uses the same levels of security as our e-banking service to protect your privacy and ensure your security on-line (see the 'e-banking service' section above). 
The identity of customers using the Abbey National e-mortgage service is confirmed through the dual use of a passcode and registration number, which have been designed in accordance with financial industry standards and best practice.
All information passed between Abbey National and customers using the e-mortgage service is sent using strong industry standard encryption technology.
When filling in your contact details within our e-mortgage service we ask for your e-mail address so that we can occasionally send you information about accounts and services which we think would be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we did not use your e-mail address in this way you can opt out by using the tick box situated there. 
If you receive e-mails and don't want to in future, please use the e-mail address below to let us remove you from our list.
