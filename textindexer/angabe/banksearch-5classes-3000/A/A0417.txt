	During the 18th century the bank prospered. Richard Hoare was knighted by Queen Anne, and became Lord Mayor of London in 1712.
	
	After Richard's death, two of his sons continued the business but it was Richard's grandson, Henry, who was the most prominent member of the family during this century. Henry was a partner for nearly 60 years and attached great importance to the success of the bank. His nickname, "Henry The Magnificent", derived in part from his influence as a great patron of the Arts, but more particularly because he laid out the gardens at Stourhead in Wiltshire, an estate bought by his father. The gardens are world famous and it is said that Stourhead inspired Capability Brown, the renowned landscape gardener, to start his career.
	
	By the beginning of the century, Messrs. Hoare had reduced their trade as goldsmiths and concentrated their energies on banking. Later on, printed cheques and passbooks (the forerunner of statements) were introduced.
	
	Famous customers of the 18th century: Lord North (Prime Minister); David Garrick (actor); Thomas Chippendale & son (furniture makers), Thomas Gainsborough (painter) and Eton College.
