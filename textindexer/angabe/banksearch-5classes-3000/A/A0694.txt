Break Free - Flexible Mortgage
Click here to find out more.
Contact Us and we will be in touch.
Full written details and quotations are available on request. All mortgages
are subject to status and valuation and are only available to persons
over the age of 18 years. The mortgage must be secured by a first charge and
a Flex Agreement on the property. Suitable buildings insurance
and life assurance are required. The advance on the Flexible Mortgage
product is restricted to a maximum of 85% of the property valuation or
purchase price, whichever is the lower. Bank of Ireland subscribes to the
Mortgage Code. Copies of the Mortgage Code are available on request.
YOUR HOME IS AT RISK IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON A MORTGAGE OR OTHER
LOANS SECURED ON IT.
