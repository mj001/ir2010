TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
The following is a summary of the main conditions that will apply to the Home Equity Release Mortgage. This is not an exhaustive list of the conditions that apply to our mortgages but are those that are most likely to impact upon you. Upon acceptance of your application we will send a mortgage offer (or Credit Agreement for loans up to £25,000) and a set of our full mortgage Terms and Conditions to the solicitor acting for you. Your solicitor will be responsible for explaining all the Terms and Conditions to you before completion of the mortgage takes place. Your solicitor does not act for us and so you are free to ask him or her to explain, impartially, how the mortgage works. 
- You or your estate must tell us when you are selling your home 
- All loan applications must comply with our current lending policy. We are not obliged to disclose the reason for an application being declined 
- We will only accept applications from those applicants who are able to sign the application form and legal documents themselves. We are unable to accept documents signed under a Power of Attorney 
- The Home Equity Release Mortgage is available on properties that are mortgage free. We will also consider properties where there is an outstanding mortgage. In this case we require any outstanding mortgage is repaid on completion of this loan. If the property is owned jointly or is to be occupied by the spouse or partner of the owner then the property must be transferred into joint ownership and then the loan must be taken out on a joint borrower basis 
- You cannot take out other loans secured on your property 
- You must be the legal owner of the property. We cannot lend to your trustees if the property is held for you under a trust arrangement 
- The interest rate charged will be fixed for a Standard Home Equity Release Mortgage and capped for a Cash Plus Home Equity Release Mortgage throughout the entire term of the loan 
- We reserve the right to sell other similar products. Depending upon market conditions at the time these may be priced higher or lower than the rates currently quoted 
- Interest will continue to be charged until the mortgage has been fully repaid 
- Interest will be charged up to the end of the calendar month in which the mortgage is repaid 
- In the event of your death, your personal representatives will have up to 18 months in which to repay the mortgage. Interest will continue to be charged during this period. If the debt has not been settled in full by the end of this period we reserve the right to repossess the property and sell it ourselves in order to recover the amount required to redeem the mortgage 
- In the event that the proposed selling price of the property is less than the amount required to repay the outstanding mortgage we reserve the right to obtain a current valuation of the property from an independent firm of valuers and to use this valuation as the basis for the recommended sale price. If for any reason the recommended sale price cannot be achieved then you will need to obtain our consent to proceed with the sale 
- In the event of a dispute between you and us with regard to the amount of the sale price, either you or we may refer the matter for arbitration by a surveyor appointed by the President of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
- Any surplus arising on a sale of the property after the mortgage is repaid in full will be returned to you. If the property is being sold as a result of your death then any surplus will belong to your estate 
- If the outstanding mortgage debt is greater than the sale price of the property and you have complied with the terms and conditions of this loan, we guarantee that your estate will not have to repay the shortfall 
- You will be allowed to continue living in the property, even if the outstanding mortgage debt ever exceeds the value of the property 
- We will continue to pay any monthly cash release until you die, move into long-term care or sell your property, even if the outstanding debt exceeds the value of the property 
- You or your estate will be responsible for any expenses, such as estate agency fees, legal fees, etc. when selling your home 
- The property must be adequately insured during the whole period of the mortgage. If we are not arranging the insurance cover then it is your responsibility to ensure that the amount and type of insurance cover is appropriate. However, we will need to have sight on an annual basis, of your policy. A small one-off charge (currently £25) will be made if you elect not to use our insurance cover 
- If you opt for our Standard Home Equity Release Mortgage and your initial loan amount is more than £25,000, we will make an Early Repayment Charge if capital repayments are made or the mortgage is fully repaid within 5 years of the start of the mortgage. This charge will not apply if full repayment of the mortgage is a result of you moving into long-term care, sheltered accommodation, selling your house or death. No Early Repayment Charge will apply to loans less than £25,000, or if you have opted for the Cash Plus version, in any circumstances 
- Notwithstanding our standard power to inspect and, if necessary, repair a property in mortgage to us, we reserve the right to value the property every three years. If we consider that an internal inspection of the property is required we will normally give you reasonable notice of the date of the re-inspection. No notice may be given in the event of an emergency. We will not make a separate charge for carrying out these three yearly re-valuations. Any re-valuation report arising from an inspection of the property is solely for our benefit and you will not receive a copy of it 
- We strongly recommend that you seek independent legal advice before applying for a Home Equity Release Mortgage 
- We strongly recommend that you discuss your intention to apply for a Home Equity Release Mortgage with your next of kin, immediate family or any other person having an interest in the property, before applying for the Home Equity Release Mortgage 
- We strongly recommend you seek qualified, independent financial advice before you take out this mortgage. You can find an independent financial advisor in your area by phoning IFA Promotion on 0117 971 1177, or visiting their website at www.ifap.org.uk They will provide the names and addresses of three local independent financial advisors. Or for more general information about obtaining financial advice contact the Financial Services Authority on 0800 917 3311. They will send you 'The FSA Guide to Financial Advice' free of charge 
- We are unable to provide advice on tax or related matters including eligibility for State or other benefits.
