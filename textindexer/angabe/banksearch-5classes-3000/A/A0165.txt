Flexible Repayment Mortgage
 
The savings compare the Flexible Repayment Mortgage with our standard 25 year Repayment Mortgage of the same
 amount.
 
Interest rates may vary which could affect repayments. Rates correct as at 14th November 2001. Typical example:
 A Flexible Repayment Mortgage of £50,000 over 18 years and 7 months at an interest rate of 5.95% (typical
 APR 6.2% variable) gives 223 monthly repayments commencing at £324.73 in the first year with repayments
 increased thereafter by 1.95% each year giving 12 repayments of £331.06, £337.51, £344.09,
 £350.79, £357.63, £364.60, £371.70, £378.94, £386.32, £393.85, £401.53,
 £409.35, £417.33, £425.46, £433.75, £442.20, £450.82 and 6 repayments of
 £459.61 and 1 final repayment of £269.21. The total amount repayable of £86,086.79 includes
 an arrangement fee of £200, estimated solicitors fees of £103.40, a security release fee of £75
 and a CHAPS fee of £22.50. The maximum loan is 95% for First Time Buyers, 90% for existing property owners,
 based on the lower of the purchase price or valuation. For loans of 90% or more Mortgage Guarantee Insurance
 is required. Loans of more than 75% of the lower of purchase price or valuation may require a professional valuation
 and an additional fee.
 
Flexible Repay Facility and Rapid Repay Facility 
 
Written quotations are available on request. All loans are subject 
 to status and applicants must be 18 or over. Security is required.
 
For Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay the minimum gross income 
 required is £25,000 single or £35,000 joint income. 
 For Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay and Clydesdale Bank 
 Rapid Repay the minimum loan amount is £40,000. These 
 Facilities are not available for business purposes.
 
The savings which you are able to make are based on comparing our 
 Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay/Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay 
 to our Standard Repayment Home Loan of the same amount. For example, 
 if you had a Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay/Clydesdale Bank Flexible 
 Repay of £50,000 and you paid £1,500 into your account 
 each month and spent £1,000 at even intervals throughout the 
 month, you would have a surplus of £500 in the account to 
 reduce your outstanding loan amount and cover any debit interest 
 due. By leaving this amount each month you could pay off your mortgage 
 13 years and 9 months early and save £23,792 in interest.
 
Interest rates may vary which could affect repayments. Rates correct 
 as at 23rd April 2002. Typical example: for a Clydesdale Bank 
 Rapid Repay/Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay of £50,000 
 over 11 years and 3 months if you paid £1,500 into your current 
 account each month and spent £1,000 at even intervals throughout 
 the month you will pay 5.24% (APR 5.4% variable). The APR 
 includes an arrangement fee of £200, legal fees estimated 
 to be £176, professional valuation estimated at £150, 
 a CHAPS fee of £22.50 and a security release fee of £75. 
 The maximum loan is 90% of the value of the property for Clydesdale 
 Bank Rapid Repay and 80% for Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay, 
 based on the lower of the purchase price or valuation. Loans more 
 than 75% of the lower of purchase price or valuation may require 
 a professional valuation and an additional fee. You will be paid 
 credit interest if the balance of your current account and Clydesdale 
 Bank Rapid Repay/ Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay is in credit 
 - please refer to the Personal Banking Tariff Guide.
 
With Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay and Clydesdale Bank 
 Flexible Repay there is no fixed repayment amount or repayment 
 frequency. You have complete flexibility to pay in additional sums 
 and withdraw sums so long as you ensure that the Limit is not exceeded. 
 With the Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay the Safety Limit reduces 
 until the loan is fully repaid and can be over any term up to 25 
 years. The Safety Limit is based on what would otherwise have been 
 the balance of our 25 year Standard Repayment Home Loan. With Clydesdale 
 Bank Flexible Repay the Limit remains unchanged for the term 
 of your loan. You must repay the whole balance of the loan outstanding 
 at the end of the term from your own resources.
 
With Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay and Clydesdale Bank 
 Flexible Repay it is a requirement that the principal borrower's 
 salary must be paid into the account.
