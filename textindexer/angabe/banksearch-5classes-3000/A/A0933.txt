Internet Banking 
 
 The ultimate easy-access option lets 
 you monitor your money when and where it suits you. At home, at 
 work, or anywhere in the world with access to the net via a PC, 
 Mac or laptop (or any device that supports 128-bit encryption). 
 You can choose when you do your banking, 24 hours a day, 7 days 
 a week*. 
 
We've made Internet Banking as simple and 
 secure as possible so you have the freedom to control your finances 
 and there are no frustrating and time wasting downloads or complex 
 graphics. 
 
What's more, apart from the costs of being 
 online, the service is absolutely free. 
 
Registration couldn't be easier. You simply 
 apply online. Once you've accepted our terms and conditions you'll 
 be straight into your accounts - and free to do whatever you want 
 to do in your own time.
