Important Information
	
Written quotations are available on request. Applicants must be aged 18 or over. Loans are subject to status and the rate at which we lend will reflect our assessment of your personal circumstances and your chosen loan amount. The APR varies depending on the amount and length of the loan and the repayment dates. Rates are correct at 31 May 2002.
	
The interest is tiered based on the loan amount requested, excluding any amount for Payment Protection Insurance. Any amount borrowed for Payment Protection Insurance will be deducted from the total loan advanced. Payment Protection Insurance is arranged by Clydesdale Bank Insurance Services on behalf of Clydesdale Bank PLC and is underwritten by various underwriters, details are available on request from any Clydesdale Bank branch.
