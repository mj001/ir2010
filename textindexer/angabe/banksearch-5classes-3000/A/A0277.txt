- You can borrow up to 80% of the valuation or purchase price of the property (whichever
 is lower)
 
- Choice of several different mortgage types
 
- Low arrangement fee (0.5%) 
 
 
Plus:
 
- Choose how to repay - Capital Repayment, Endowment, Pension Plan or Individual Savings
 Account
 
- Mortgage term can range from 3 years to retirement or age 70, whichever is earlier
 
 
 
 
 
- Variable Rate Buy To Let 
 
 
 
This package is ideal if you want a variable rate and the flexibility to make extra
 payments into your mortgage. There is an arrangement fee of £295 for mortgages below
 £35,000.
 
 
 
 
- Fixed Rate Buy To Let
 
 
 
We offer a choice of 2, 3 or 5 year fixed rates, giving you the security of knowing
 that no matter what happens to general interest rates, your payments will not change
 during the fixed period. 
 
There is an arrangement fee of £295 payable when
 booking a fixed or capped rate. This secures the rate you have chosen for a period of 3
 months. This means that even if we change the fixed rate or it is withdrawn from sale, we
 will still honour the rate agreed with you. This fee is non-refundable.
 
Fixed rate mortgages are subject to
 availability of funds. We would advise that, where a rate is chosen, funds
 are booked as soon as possible. The maximum amount for a fixed rate
 mortgage is normally £500,000, however applications in excess of this
 amount will be considered on an individual basis.
 
Typical example: based on a capital 
 repayment mortgage of £75,000 (property valued at £100,000). For each 
 example there are 300 monthly repayments, the arrangement fee of 0.5% of 
 the loan, booking fee of £295 in the case of a fixed rate, solicitors 
 and valuation fees of £470, other Bank fees of £100 and life assurance 
 premiums of £10.71 per month. The early repayment will be incurred if the
 mortgage is repaid in full of if a different Royal Bank mortgage is switched to during the
 period shown. At the end of the fixed rate the Bank's standard variable Mortgage Rate will
 apply, which is currently 5.95%. No account has been taken of any future changes in the
 Bank's mortgage rate which we may change at any time. The maximum early repayment charge
 based on these examples is £300.
