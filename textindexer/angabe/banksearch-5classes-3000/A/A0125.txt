Freestyle - flexibility at its best. 
Ever since we launched Freestyle Mortgages, we've been providing our 
customers with outstanding value, service and flexibility. After all, we wanted 
to create a range of mortgages which would give our customers choice while still 
offering them a better deal all round.
Freestyle is all about choice. It's about selecting the options that are right 
for you now - and being able to adapt them at any time in the future.
Many of the questions commonly asked about our mortgages apply to all of the different options in the Freestyle range. Here's a selection of things you'll need to know regardless of which choices you're planning to make.

How much can I borrow?
As long as you can afford the payments, we’ll be willing to lend up to 95% of your property’s value - up to a maximum of £250,000. However if you’re borrowing up to 75% of the value of your property, we could lend you up to £750,000.

Can I mix fixed and variable rates?
In most cases, yes. For example, you could have a portion of your mortgage at a variable rate (which would be discounted for the initial period) while the rest could be fixed (subject to availability). If you choose to use our offsetting facility, you cannot have a fixed rate portion within your mortgage.

Do I have options on how I can repay?
You can pay interest only - which means that you will have to run a suitable investment plan alongside your mortgage (such as an endowment policy or other long term investment) which will then clear the capital sum borrowed at the end of the mortgage term. 
Alternatively, you can pay capital and interest where each monthly payment covers both the interest due and part of the capital, reducing your outstanding loan each month. You can also split your mortgage so that a portion is paid interest only while the remainder is capital and interest. In the case of our 25 year fixed rate mortgage, only the capital and interest method applies.
 
Back to top    
 
How long can I take to repay?
It’s up to you to decide how long you want to take to repay your mortgage. The minimum period is dependent on your chosen mortgage and must be repaid by the time you are 65 (or 67 in the case of our 25 year fixed rate mortgage). The less time you take, the higher your monthly repayments will be. You should note that you can make overpayments on the variable rate portion of a Freestyle Mortgage at any time. You can even have different portions of the mortgage over different periods.

Can I borrow more money in the future?
Again the answer is yes. When you first apply for your Freestyle Mortgage, we’ll agree how much we’re willing to lend you. If you draw down less than the amount we are prepared to lend you, and you can afford the repayments, you’ll have access to a Cash Reserve. 
You can pay back any amount borrowed from your Cash Reserve over the term that suits you. Best of all, you’ll be borrowing at Freestyle Mortgage rates and that can mean a considerable saving when compared with other forms of finance. 
Even if you borrow the full 95% at the start of your Freestyle Mortgage, you may qualify for Cash Reserv in the future. Simply contact us for more details at that time. 
You can borrow any amount from £1,000 to the maximum of your Cash Reserve and pay it back over the term that suits you. Note that your Cash Reserve must be repaid by the end of your mortgage term or by the time you are 65 (67 in the case of our 25 year fixed rate mortgage) whichever is sooner. 
Back to top    
 
How are repayments made?
Monthly payments are made by Direct Debit. You can choose the day in the month which suits you and you can change it at any time. 
 
Back to top    
 
Will I get regular statements?
Mortgage statements are sent out every six months or can be viewed online. They detail the transactions and outstanding balances of your mortgage accounts. They will also show, if applicable, how much Cash Reserve remains available to you. You can also request an interim statement at any time. Please note, however, that this will not detail how much is available in your Cash Reserve.

Can my Freestyle Mortgage move with me when I move house?
Yes. Your mortgage can move with you and, if you have a discounted variable rate element to your mortgage, a further discount will be available if you move house. Just call us when you decide to move, and we’ll take you through the process. If you require additional funding, we’ll be happy to consider your application for further funds. 
Back to top    
 
Can I make overpayments on my Freestyle Mortgage?
Yes. You can make overpayments either regularly or as a lump sum on any variable rate portion of your mortgage. The effect of overpayments also applies immediately because we calculate interest daily. This can reduce the term of your mortgage and save you money in interest. Any overpayments you make also go into your Cash Reserve and can be borrowed back whenever you want. Overpayments on a fixed rate mortgage will be subject to early redemption penalties. 
Back to top    
 
Can I take a payment holiday?
Once you’ve made six consecutive payments you can take up to two payment holidays a year (subject to available reserve and ability to pay). To arrange a payment holiday, just call us 22 days in advance of when you want to miss your payment. 
Back to top    
 
Are there any initial costs involved?
A Booking Fee will be payable on our fixed rate mortgages and a set up charge is made if you opt for the Freestyle offsetting facility. Please refer to our tariff of charges for further information.
By taking out a Freestyle Mortgage you will also benefit from a number of savings compared with other mortgage lenders including.
	
- No Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee premium 
	
- Standard valuation fee refunded on completion 
	
- Contribution of up to £200 towards legal fees on completion 
	
- No mortgage arrangement fee for variable rate mortgages (other than for the offsetting reserve facility)

What happens when a fixed rate or a discounted period finishes?
When a fixed rate or a discounted rate period finishes, the rate will automatically revert to the appropriate standard variable rate (except in the case of the 25 year fixed rate mortgage) and we’ll write to tell you how much your payments will be. At this point you could opt for a fixed rate, subject to availability.

What is offsetting?
Offsetting is a great feature only available on our variable rate Freestyle Mortgages. Basically, it’s a savings account (known as an Offsetting Reserve Account) linked to your mortgage. You can pay into (or make withdrawals from) this account at any time online or by phone . While we don’t pay you interest on the money in this account, we don’t charge any interest on the equivalent amount of money in your mortgage. So, effectively you’ll earn the same interest on your savings as you’re being charged on your mortgage.
Back to top    
 
What are the benefits of offsetting?
If you offset savings against your mortgage, you’re effectively borrowing less. So you pay less interest. This can either be used to reduce your monthly mortgage payment or reduce the term of your mortgage. 
There’s another saving too. If you’re a taxpayer, you pay tax at your top rate on any savings interest you earn. Because you don’t actually get paid interest on your Offsetting Reserve Account, you don’t pay any tax on the benefit that your account is generating. 
Back to top    
 
Will I pay a higher interest rate on my mortgage if I choose to offset?
No. We even offer the offsetting feature on our discounted rates. Please note however, if you’re an existing Freestyle customer, you will not qualify for a new discount. 
Back to top    
 
How do I withdraw and deposit money from my Offsetting Reserve Account?
Moving money in and out of your Offsetting Reserve Account is as easy as dealing with any Standard Life Bank savings account. The account is linked to your external bank account and transaction instructions are made by you either online or by phone and transferred by direct debit. Withdrawals normally take three working days to clear. You must leave at least £1 in your Offsetting Reserve Account at all times. 
Back to top    
 
Can I offset my existing Standard Life Bank savings accounts?
No, but you can easily move money from other savings accounts into your Offsetting Reserve Account.
Your Offsetting Reserve Account is only used to save interest on your mortgage, so it can’t be ‘pooled’ with other Standard Life Bank savings accounts.

Insurance
Having the right level of cover is essential with any mortgage and Freestyle is no different. Here’s a quick guide to the cover you will need and some options that you may also want to consider.
What insurance cover will I need to have?
You must take out buildings insurance before we release your mortgage funds and it must remain in place throughout the term of your mortgage. While you can choose any insurance company, you’ll find that Standard Life Bank can arrange Home Insurance that has been developed to meet all your needs for comprehensive buildings and contents cover at a very competitive price. 
Summary of Benefits
- New for old cover on your contents
- No application forms
- 24 hour helpline
- Optional accidental damage cover
- Minimum buildings cover £250,000, contents £35,000
For more information just call us on 0845 600 1601 or speak to your financial adviser.

Can I protect my payments?
If you were unable to work because of an accident, sickness or unemployment, Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance could protect your standard of living. We can provide this cover for just £4.70 per £100 of mortgage repayment due (which is extremely competitive compared to the industry average of £5.50*). 
Summary of Benefits
- Meets your mortgage payments for up to one year
- Extremely competitive cover of £4.70 per £100 of monthly mortgage repayments due 
- Option to take an additional 25% protection to cover mortgage-related costs (e.g. endowment policy, council tax, gas bill etc.)
Just call 0845 601 2357 or speak to your financial adviser for further details. Please note that if you’re an existing customer and have not previously taken out Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance, you will not then be eligible for this protection cover. 
* Survey carried out in 2001 by the Council of Mortgage Lenders into the weighted average price of accident, sickness and unemployment cover.

What other cover can I arrange?
Since your mortgage is likely to be your single biggest liability, it’s also likely to be the most difficult commitment for your family to meet if you were to die. If you were to suffer a critical illness, you may also find it difficult to make your mortgage payments. The Lifetime Protection Plan can provide you and your family tailored cover in either event. The competitively priced plan pays out a lump sum benefit so that any remaining mortgage can be paid off.
Summary of Benefits
- Can be set up to provide life insurance or critical illness cover or both
- Suitable for repayment or capital and interest mortgages
- Can be set up to cover one life or two lives arranging a mortgage
- You can add extra options (for a slightly higher cost) allowing you to increase benefits later without having to provide medical evidence
Standard Life, Europe’s largest mutual life assurance company, provides the plan. They can cover you for up to 35 years. Just call one of their experienced operators on 0800 333 377 for more details or speak to your financial adviser.
