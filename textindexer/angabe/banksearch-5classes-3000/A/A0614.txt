 As soon as you open a current account with The Royal Bank of Scotland,
 you&#146;ll realise that not all bank accounts are the same. We can give you everything
 you&#146;d expect from a bank account plus a whole range of money saving benefits.
In a recent survey of current account customers in the UK we came
 out top for overall customer satisfaction and top for understanding customer needs.*
 We&#146;ve also just won the Best Telephone Banking Award in the 2001 &#145;Your Money
 Direct&#146; readership survey.+
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
So it&#146;s not hard to see why we are more likely to be
 recommended than other high street banks. And it couldn&#146;t be easier to switch to the
 Royal Bank. All it takes is one signature to arrange the 
 transfer and we&#146;ll take
 care of the rest. Even sorting your direct debits and standing orders.
