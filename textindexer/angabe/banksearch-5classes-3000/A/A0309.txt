All interest is calculated daily and credited/debited to accounts monthly. Although cheques credited to accounts are shown on statements on the day of receipt, they are still subject to bank clearance arrangements. At least four banking days should normally be allowed for clearance from the time a deposit reaches our processing centre before a withdrawal is made against it. 
*AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest 
 rate would be if interest was paid and compounded each year.
 **Effective Annual Rate illustrates what the annual interest would be on a debit 
 balance where interest is compounded monthly.
 ***Overdrafts up to £2,500 qualify for 0% interest for the first 12 months from account opening only (£2,500 is a maximum free limit and is not an automatic limit). Thereafter, the account will revert to the standard overdraft rate charge, currently 0.79% per month. Our standard EAR is 9.9% (variable). This offer is only applicable to new current account customers, opening an account on or after 27 May 2002 (not available to our existing current account customers).

*Paid items are items we pay where you may have incurred or have incurred 
 an unauthorised overdraft (including 'Forced to Pay' items such as guaranteed 
 cheques and debit card transactions).
Cash withdrawals made abroad are subject to a 1.5% (minimum £1.50) cash 
 advance charge, in addition to a conversion fee of 2.75% of the value of the 
 transaction. All cash withdrawals from Alliance & Leicester cash machines 
 are free
 If you would like the flexibility of being able to overdraw your account, 
 our Premier Current Account overdraft facility allows you to draw cash and write 
 cheques up to an agreed limit. There is no arrangement fee or monthly fee to 
 pay as long as you stay within your agreed limit and the interest rates are 
 shown above.
Fixed Term overdrafts carry an administration fee of £25. This is in 
 addition to the interest charged on the overdrawn balance.
Separate charges are made for international transactions and may also be made 
 for other work of an exceptional nature. All charges are debited to the Premier 
 Current Account.
Interest will normally be paid after tax has been deducted at the rate set 
 by the Inland Revenue. However, if you are registered for gross interest, it 
 will be paid without tax taken off. If you pay more than your liability for 
 tax, you can reclaim the excess from the Inland Revenue. If you are liable to 
 a higher rate tax, you may have to pay extra income tax. For more information, 
 contact your local Inland Revenue office.
Premier Current Account holders must be aged 21 or over. A minimum of £500 
 net monthly must be credited to the Premier Current Account.
