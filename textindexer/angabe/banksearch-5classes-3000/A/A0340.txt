It is accepted wisdom that an investor should spread money between different types of investment. However, always look at the worst-case scenario for each investment and be sure that you accept, and can afford, the risks involved.

	Investment precautions 
 
Investors should first ensure they minimise the risk of having to sell investments at a loss to pay unexpected bills. This means keeping money on instant access deposit although the returns may be unexciting. The well placed and cautious may deposit enough to cover six months' living costs, perhaps around £10,000. Others may take the risk that less should be enough to tide them over.

 Investment categories 
 
Deposits, bonds and equities form the lion's 
 share of most portfolios. Deposits are conservative investments but carry the risk that they may decrease in value over time especially if inflation or cost-of-living rises outpace the interest on offer. To manage this risk, many investors look to preserve the strength of their portfolios through exposure to investments where the value of the capital is likely to rise. This usually means equities. Generally the younger investor with a longer-term horizon will rely largely on equities; the middle-aged investor with a medium-term horizon will diversify more into bonds and some cash; while the elderly saver with a shorter-term horizon and sufficient to cover living costs will major on cash and minor on equities and bonds.

 Investment risks 
 
With all portfolios there is a risk that tax will erode gains and even turn a positive return into a loss. You need to understand how to invest tax efficiently using vehicles including pensions, Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) and some National Savings products. 
 
 Investors can further manage risk by choosing product providers with care and avoiding obscure institutions offering suspiciously above-average returns. Many jurisdictions, including the UK, have investor compensation schemes in the event of an institution's failure. A check with the Financial Services Authority can establish entitlement. Each investment product has its own risk. Each risk needs to be appreciated on an individual basis: then the investor has to understand the portfolio's overall downside that is determined by the combination of risks taken on. 
 
 
 BONDS Many conservative investors with an investment time horizon of more than five years look hard at with profits bonds. Historically they have performed better than building society investments although, as with all investments, there is no guarantee they will continue to do so. All withdrawals and capital gains from such investments are free of basic rate tax. Distribution bonds are a little higher up the risk scale. The value of these bonds reflects the underlying investments they hold and this means rises and falls in the stock market influences the price. Many are conservatively invested and they are considered to be less risky than pure equities. With profits and distribution bonds may impose penalties if sold in the first five years so investors risk losing some of the gains if they cash them in early. 
 
EQUITIES Equities are often the highest risk sectors of portfolios. However, income from equities has over the past 30 years doubled every seven years. Investors in cash take the risk that they will miss out on any such future appreciation although the difficulties experienced by stock markets in 2000 reinforces the message that equities carry a strong measure of risk. Regular savings plans, especially over at least five years or more, can help spread risk. This is because you can avoid buying a large number of shares when the market is high. Additionally, investors can use investment vehicles like unit trusts, investment trusts or Oeics, (Open-Ended Investment Companies), to ensure diversification. Such vehicles pool money from a large number of investors and buy a spread of stock and shares that the individual would find it impossible to achieve. Investors with sufficient capital can further diversify by using a number of different funds. But the risk is that too much diversification might dilute the returns. Even the well-informed investor may need advice to arrive at the best equity exposure to suit their risk tolerance and investment objectives.

The table above gives a general guide to risk. The prospects of shares and equity investments depend on the performance of the relevant underlying investments and, although growth prospects may be good, the capital sum invested may suffer losses. The time column gives an indication of the generally accepted minimum periods that investors should consider when making the relevant investment decision.

	Investment strategies 
	
The best way to manage the overall risk is to review the portfolio regularly and make considered changes if you are sure they will benefit you. Your investment strategy should be designed to take the minimum risk necessary to accomplish your aims. When circumstances change, it might have to change too. Remember, the more a portfolio has to stretch to meet living costs, the greater the risks to the lump sum.
