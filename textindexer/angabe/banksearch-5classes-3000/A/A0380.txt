 Abbey National offers several convenient methods for sending and receiving overseas
payments. The method you choose will depend on the amount involved and how quickly you
want it to be transferred.
 
 
 Abbey National, like many other financial organisations, uses a system called 'credit
scoring' to assess the potential risk involved in extending credit.
 
 
 These set out the contract between you and us, explain our obligation to you, and your
obligations to us and may be varied by us.
