	when completing online applications on the Lloyds TSB website, do not leave the screen idle for more than 10 minutes as the application process will close automatically and any information will be lost. You should also make sure no-one else can access your internet machine during your online application 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	choose "strong" passwords (alphanumeric) and change them regularly; avoid obvious passwords (names of family members, pets, favourite musician etc), and don't tell anyone else your passwords. You should not write a password down 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	if you think someone knows your password go online and change it immediately 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	if you are using the Internet in a public place (e.g. a Cyber Cafe) do not leave the PC unattended, and ensure that no-one is watching what you type 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	logoff from online banking upon completion of your session. This will prevent the viewing of previous pages of your online session via your PC 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	do not respond to e-mails that request you reply with your password - including those that appear to be from Lloyds TSB 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	we recommend you do not download software (games, utilities etc) if you do not trust - or are not sure of - the source 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	we recommend that you use Anti-virus software. If kept up-to-date this should protect your PC against the latest viruses 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	
	 
	
	we also suggest that you consider running a Personal Firewall, which will prevent unauthorised persons from accessing your computer and guard against the introduction of malicious programs onto your PC
