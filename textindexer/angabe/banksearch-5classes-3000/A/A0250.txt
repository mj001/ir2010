Financial Services Europe Half-Year Results
National Australia Group today released a consolidated half-year result for its Financial Services Europe division (the retail banking arm of the Group in Great Britain and Ireland) announcing profits after tax of £170 million, an increase of 16.4% over the previous corresponding period. 
"This is another strong performance, achieved despite an increasingly competitive environment resulting from industry consolidation, particularly in Great Britain", said Steve Targett, Chief Executive for Europe.
"With the continued growth of our businesses, the opening of our second European Customer Contact Centre reflects our ability to deal with customers at times that are suitable to them. Alongside the introduction of Internet banking in Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks, this has added to the means by which customers can access our services," added Mr Targett.
Net interest income increased by 13.3% to £425 million, reflecting the success of new product launches and more focussed targeting of customers.
Gross Loans and acceptances increased 9% year on year, largely due to growth in mortgage lending and personal loans. Retail deposits grew 14% in the same period. 
Other operating expenses increased to £303m (up 6.7%). Contributing factors included the opening of additional Regional Business centres, the operating costs associated with the European Customer Contact Centre and the implementation of the Euro in Ireland.
Tight cost controls were maintained with the cost to income ratio improving to 49.2%.
