	What am I able to use Internet Banking for?	
	
	Our Internet Banking Service provides you with access to your current and available balances on all of your accounts (with the exception of ISA&rsquo;s and certain Term Deposit accounts) and also details of your last 100 days&rsquo; transactions. You have the facility to transfer funds between any Clydesdale Bank accounts you hold and also to make payments via the service to any outside company or other bank. It is also possible to order a chequebook, and up-to-date statement.	
	
	When is Internet banking available?	
	
	Internet Banking is normally available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, there may be times when a part of the service is unavailable to allow for maintenance and updates to the system.	
	
	Is Internet banking secure?	
	
	Initially for someone to gain access to your account details they would have to have five pieces of information that only you should know. After you have registered there are three pieces of information required (two of which you can change at any time) before you can access the system. 
The keys to security are your customer number and your Internet Banking password. It is vital that these are not disclosed to anyone. If at anytime you suspect that these have been compromised then you should immediately change your password and security questions. 
Information passed between your computer and the Bank is encrypted and in the unlikely event of any third party seeing a message it is unreadable. Clydesdale Bank uses 128-bit encryption as well as multiple firewall technology.	
	
	How can I add a new account to my Internet banking facility?	
	
	Normally when you open a new account with the Bank it will be added to your list of accounts. This may take a couple of weeks to be processed. However, if you find that an account is not available and you wish access to it, please call the Telephone Banking service on 0845 7 365 365. Between the hours of 8am-8pm, Mon-Fri, new accounts can be added to your Internet facility.	
	
	Will I be able to see my Clydesdale Bank credit cards?	
	
	Yes, credit cards are easily accessed through Internet Banking. In addition to the balance and transactions on your credit card, you will also be able to transfer funds to and from the card at any time. If your card is currently available through your Telephone Banking facility then it should be automatically available through Internet Banking. If not, then please follow the above procedure for adding new accounts to the service. Transfers or payments from your credit card will be treated as cash withdrawals and therefore charges will apply.	
	
	I am unable to view the last 100 days transactions on my credit card?	
	
	Credit cards only begin to accumulate transactions on Internet Banking from the date you register with the service or the date you add on your credit card, whichever is later. Therefore, if you have only been registered with the service for 10 days or added on your card 10 days ago, then you can only access the last 10 days transactions.	
	
	Can I view my Direct Debits and Standing Orders?	
	
	You can view any paid Direct Debits or Standing Orders through Transactions. There is not currently an available screen displaying a list of Direct Debits and Standing Orders. Direct Debits and Standing Orders cannot be cancelled or amended through Internet Banking, however you can arrange this by calling 0845 7 365 365.	
	
	Can I still use Telephone Banking?	
	
	Other Clydesdale Bank services remain unaffected by your use of Internet Banking. You will still have the same access to them as you did previously.	
	
	What if my account information looks incorrect?	
	
	If any information on your account looks incorrect or suspicious in any way you can contact your account holding branch or the Customer Contact Center (0845 7 365 365).	
	
	Can my account information be viewed by anyone else?	
	
	Internet Banking encrypts all information sent between your browser and the Bank. Your customer number and password protect your Internet Banking account. Your accounts cannot be accessed without this information. You should be aware that some browsers can store Internet pages that you have viewed, locally. This could then be viewed by anyone with access to that computer. 
It is strongly recommended that you do not use this facility. If you have already selected this and wish to remove it please refer to the help section of your browser relating to the save encrypted pages to disk facility.	
	
	Internet Banking is running very slow, am I doing something wrong?	
	
	If the service is running abnormally slow it is possible you have too many other applications open at the same time. Therefore other applications may need to be closed to optimise the speed.	
	
	If I have a joint Current Account, can we both use the online banking service?	
	
	Yes, however both of you will have separate customer numbers and should register different security information. It is strongly recommended that you keep your security details to yourself and do not disclose them to your partner.	
	
	My partner on my joint account cannot view a future dated bill payment, which I set up?	
	
	Both parties to a joint account have separate customer numbers that identify them within the Bank. We use your customer number as part of Internet Banking security, therefore the payment you have set up is recorded under your customer number and not the actual account number. As such joint account holders cannot view payments set up using their partners customer ID number.	
	
	Can I use financial software such as Microsoft Money with Internet Banking?	
	
	Yes, the Export option that appears on your screen will allow you to copy information on your Internet Banking into a relevant package.	
	
	How can I print the information I want?	
	
	There is an option on the screen for Print. This allows you to print directly from Internet Banking. Alternatively, you can export the data into a financial software package and print from there.	
	
	Why does the service sign me off after a period of time?	
	
	As an automatic security measure if you are idle for 10 minutes the service will sign itself off, meaning that you will have to log back in when you attempt to use it again. We strongly recommend that you do not rely on this facility, and if you are planning to leave your PC for any length of time that you log out of Internet Banking.	
	
	How do I logoff or disconnect?	
	
	You simply click on logout on the menu and the system will disconnect from the Internet Banking server. You will have to log back in with your security information next time you want to access your accounts.
