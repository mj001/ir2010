We knew you would be. That's why we've made it extraordinarily easy for you to switch to us. It's now so easy to do, there's no excuse for having an ordinary current account.
All we ask in return is that you pay £1,000 or more into your current account each month. Even if you don't, we still offer a competitive selection of bank accounts with a variety of features and benefits.
 
The new Halifax Current Account will change the way you think about banking forever!
