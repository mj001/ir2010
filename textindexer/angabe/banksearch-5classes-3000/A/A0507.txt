	Since our first HOBS service was originally launched in 1985, there have been a number of developments, improvements and additions to the HOBS "family" of services. As these changes have been implemented we have released newer versions of the software and distributed these to customers. Should you wish to check that you currently have and are using the most up-to-date version of software for your own service, run your HOBS program, then click on "Help" and "About HOBS". This will tell you the version number that is operating on your PC. Compare it to the latest versions noted below:
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	Business HOBS Software version 2.2 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	Corporate HOBS Software version 2.2 
	
	
	
	 
	
	What to do if you do not have one of these versions: 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	If you are currently using an older version, please check to ensure that any HOBS upgrade disks or CDs which may have been sent to you recently have been correctly installed. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	If you have disk/s or CD/s with the version numbers detailed above, but this is not the version installed on your PC, please run the upgrade routine on the disk/s or CD/s. 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	If you do not have the latest version noted above, and do not have disks for this version, please contact the HOBS Help Desk on 0845 300 6444 (open 7am to 11pm). 
	
	
	 
	
	
	 
	If you require any assistance with running an upgrade, please also contact the HOBS Help Desk.
