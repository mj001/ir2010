Product Description
 
This 100% principal protected, 6 month Market Linked 
 Deposit is linked to the exchange rate between GBP/ 
 USD**.
 
If you choose this MLD as long as the GBP/USD exchange 
 rate** doesn't strengthen by more than 5% from the initial 
 strike rate you will benefit from 100% participation 
 in this appreciation. If the exchange rate is 5% higher 
 than the strike rate at anytime during the 6 month tenure 
 you will receive an annual gross rate of 2% (2.01%AER)*at 
 maturity. If the GBP/USD exchange rate** depreciates 
 from the strike rate, you will only receive your initial 
 deposit at maturity.
 
Other Conditions:
 The deposit will be issued subject to the collection 
 of a minimum of GBP 1 million in the event the minimum 
 amount is not collected, you will receive your money 
 back with interest as per the market rate prevalent 
 for day deposits. During the subscription period the 
 money invested will be kept in your Citibank Account. 
 You have the right to cancel your MLD within 14 days 
 of our opening of the MLD account. If you cancel your 
 MLD we will either help you switch to another account 
 or we will give you all your money back with any interest 
 it has earned. For detailed terms and conditions please 
 refer to the MLD account opening form.

 of interest payable not taking into account payment 
 of income tax at the basic rate. The AER is the nominal 
 rate that illustrates the contractual interest rate 
 (excluding any bonus payable) as if paid and compounded 
 on an annual basis. Interest rates are variable and 
 correct at time of print.

Risk Disclosure
 The interest rate in respect of the Market Linked 
 Deposit is generally higher than that of a Traditional 
 Deposit. However, such an opportunity carries 
 with it investment risk because adverse exchange 
 rate, price or stock index movements can reduce 
 or erase some or all of your interest earnings. 
 Past performance is not a guarantee of future 
 performance. You will receive your principal amount 
 deposited upon maturity. However there is no certainty 
 that you will receive any interest. You should, 
 therefore, have knowledge of the movements of 
 the relevant currency, commodity or stock prices 
 and should carefully consider whether the Market 
 Linked Deposits is suitable in the light of your 
 financial objectives. All Market Linked Deposits 
 are solely payable at Citibank International plc. 
 London. DEPOSIT IS NOT FDIC INSURED AND THE REPAYMENT 
 OF THE DEPOSIT IS SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND THE 
 REGULATIONS OF ENGLAND AND WALES.
