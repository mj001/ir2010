ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
VALUATIONS 
 In order to allow us to establish whether your property represents adequate security for a mortgage, and to allow us to calculate exactly how much you may be able to borrow, we will need to carry out a mortgage valuation. 
You must pay the valuation fee when you apply for your mortgage. Our mortgage valuation fee charging scale is shown below. 
This valuation will either be carried out by a valuer employed by us, or an independent panel valuer. 
Although you will receive a copy of the report, it is primarily to enable us to assess the property as security for your loan. 
Consequently the report will only be based on a limited inspection. As it is not detailed, there may be aspects of the property which are not relevant to us, but which will matter to you. 
If you would like to obtain a more detailed inspection of your property before proceeding, please ask for details from us about the costs of the different types of report. 
Once your mortgage has started we may revalue the property every three years. The report provided by the valuer will be solely for our benefit and you will not see a copy of it. The cost of these re-valuations is included in the Arrangement Fee charged on completion of this loan.

The fees shown include a non-refundable administration charge of £125. 
The balance is the valuer's fee, which cannot be refunded once the valuation has been carried out. 
The valuation fee shown is for a mortgage valuation report. If you require a more detailed report on the property, we can introduce you to firms of Chartered Surveyors you can instruct to carry out either a Homebuyers Survey and Valuation, or a Building Survey. Different charges will apply for these types of reports. 
If required, we can provide you with further information about the different types of report available. 
LEGAL WORK
 A firm of solicitors will act for us in arranging this mortgage. Any charges for this are included in the Arrangement Fee charged on completion of this loan. 
An independent firm of solicitors or licensed conveyancers must act for you to complete your mortgage and, if required, transferring the property into the ownership of both applicants. 
Your solicitor or licensed conveyancer will advise you about the charge that they will make, including disbursements, for completing all necessary legal work. You will be responsible for your own solicitor's or licensed conveyancer's fees. 
INSURANCE 
 Our Supercover Gold insurance offers comprehensive insurance for your home, contents and possessions. Please see our separate leaflet which gives full details.
If you arrange your own buildings and contents insurance we will need to have sight, on an annual basis, of your policy to ensure that any insurance is adequate to protect the buildings. A small one-off charge (currently £25) will be made to cover the cost of additional administration work. 
OTHER CHARGES 
 The normal day to day management of your mortgage will usually be conducted free of additional charges. However, we do charge for providing some specific services and, where these apply, our current charges are shown below. These charges may vary. Deeds related
