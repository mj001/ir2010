What's needed?
 
When opening an account with The
 Royal Bank of Scotland, we want to make sure you receive outstanding customer service.
 Therefore, as part of our aim to protect existing and new customers from the risks of
 fraud and to minimise the instances of money laundering there is a requirement to
 undertake identification and address verification for all new accounts that are
 opened. This applies to both new and existing customers.
 
If you are a new or existing customer, we will need
 to see original documentary proof of your identity and your address. We will need one
 item from the Identification Table and one item from the Address
 Verification Table.
 
Also if you are a new
 customer and you have an existing current account with another bank/building
 society it may help to bring along one month's recent statement.
 
However, if you can't
 supply one item from the Identification Table and one from the Address Verification Table, please refer to a member of staff who will be able to help.

How to transfer from another bank/building society?
 
Moving
 your current account to The Royal Bank of Scotland has never been easier. All we need is
 one signature to arrange the transfer and we will take care of the rest!
 
We will set up all your Direct Debits and standing orders, arrange the transfer of any
 salary/pension payments and close your existing bank account after regular payments have
 been confirmed and set up.
 
We will also ensure the transfer is completed at no inconvenience to you.
