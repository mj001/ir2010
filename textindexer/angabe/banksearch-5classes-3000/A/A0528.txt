People with disabilities
 
2001 saw Barclays make major new commitments 
 to two new projects for disabled people. We committed £1.69 
 million over three years to an exciting new project with the 
 RNID:Together IT Works. This project is developing 
 a fully accredited IT training course for deaf people, who 
 have one of the highest rates of unemployment in the UK. The 
 course will help the deaf and hard of hearing gain the IT 
 skills they need to compete in the job market. Our funding 
 will help secure the expertise needed to develop training 
 techniques, as well as specialised software and training materials. 
 We are also providing £1.29 million over three years 
 from 2001 to the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) 
 to set up Talk & Support. This is a telephone support 
 and counselling service for newly registered blind and partially-sighted 
 people, offering practical advice and friendship through this 
 difficult period in their lives.
