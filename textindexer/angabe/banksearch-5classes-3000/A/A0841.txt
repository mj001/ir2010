Introduced by Hampshire Trust in 1995 and has proved to be an overwhelming success.
Designed specifically for the purchase of commercial property in situations where time is of the essence; for example, where contracts have been exchanged and the completion date is looming (or may even have passed!) but for one reason or another the anticipated funding has failed to materialise. The whole process from initial interview to release of funds can take as little as 5 working days!.
Our basic criteria is as follows:-
 
- 
 
Loans available from £25,001 to
 £500,000.
 
- 
 
All loans are secured by a first mortgage on property situated in mainland England or Wales.
 
- 
 
Maximum loan-to-value 70% of the available security.
 
- 
 
Minimum term 3 months.
