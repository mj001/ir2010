There are a number of JSP directives, besides the page directive. 
Besides the page directives, the other most useful directives are include
and taglib. We will be covering taglib separately.
The include directive is used to physically include the contents of
another file. The included file can be HTML or JSP or anything else
-- the result is as if the original JSP file actually contained the included
text. To see this directive in action, create a new JSP
Going to include hello.jsp...
View this JSP in your browser, and you will see your original hello.jsp
get included in the new JSP.
Exercise: Modify all your earlier exercises to import the
java.util packages.
