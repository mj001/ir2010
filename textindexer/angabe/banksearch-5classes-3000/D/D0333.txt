	mauve testsuite results 
 
 
 
 
 The Mauve Project
 is a collaborative effort comprised of several groups that
 seeks to provide a compliance test again the Java specification.
 
 
 While at present the mauve testsuite comprises tests of library
 functionality and not vm behavior, I thought it would be interesting to 
 run it again japhar, testing both 1.1 and 1.2 JDK classes. Here are the
 results:
 
 
 
- Mauve against Japhar/JDK-1.1
 
- Mauve against Japhar/JDK-1.2
