	Using SOAP with Java
	Brush up on how to use Java and SOAP together in this three part
	series. In Part 1, Samudra Gupta discusses the basic anatomy of 
	SOAP, the installation of Apache SOAP 2.2 and configuration 
	issues with Jakarta Tomcat 3.2.1 as well as how to develop, 
	deploy and execute a very basic SOAP application.
	
	
	Coding your second Jakarta Struts Application
	Keld Hansen takes another step up the Struts ladder. This month 
	he shows you how to build a classic list-detail application with 
	the well-known CRUD-actions: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
	
	
	J2EE and XML Development
 Geared toward experienced developers, this reference demonstrates how Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Editi
	on (J2EE), and XML technologies can be used together to create more robust distributed applications and softwar
	e systems. The use of XML technology to extend and enhance the capabilities of the J2EE platform is covered in
	detail.	
	
 
 Stepping through Jakarta Struts
 Struts, from the Jakarta
 Project, is a development framework for Java servlet applications
 based upon the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm. Keld
 Hansen gives a quick intro to Struts, covering the necessary details
 to make it possible to build a simple one-page example containing an
 HTML form. In Part 2 Keld will refine the example to show additional features
 of Struts.
	
	Using Chained Exceptions in JDK 1.4
	The new JDK 1.4, which was released a few months ago, contains several very useful features which will help the programmer making more robust applications. In this article Keld Hansen looks at one of the features--the extension to the Throwable class which makes "exception chaining" possible.
	
	
Java Web Services
	Java Web Services shows you how to use SOAP to perform remote method calls and message passing; how to use WSDL to describe the interface to a web service or understand the interface of someone else's service; and how to use UDDI to advertise (publish) and look up services in each local or global registry. From O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.
	
Web Services with Axis
An introduction to web services for those 
of you who think that web services are only for computer nerds. They're not. If 
you think otherwise it might be because of the many difficult-to-read articles 
that have tried to address the subject, often in very technical terms. Web 
services are nothing but two programs interchanging data on the Internet--or an 
intranet--in the XML-based format called SOAP.
	
	
	Jython for Java Programmers
	Jython for Java Programmers provides a brief introduction to show the differences between Java and 
	Jython, but focuses on utilizing Jython with Java by covering the following: extending Python with 
	java classes, modules, compiling, interpreters, design integration, etc. The Chapter 12 excerpt covers 	Server-Side Web Programming. From New Riders
	
	Java and JDOM: the perfect couple 
	In this article Keld Hansen shows you how to read and write 
	an XML file, focusing on how to edit the document tree: adding, 
	changing, or deleting the elements. If you hang on until the end 
	of the article you'll be rewarded with a complete web application 
	to manage your DVD library.
