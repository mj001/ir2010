	 ReqwirelessWeb
	 Don't be content with hard-to-find, uninspiring WML. Use ReqwirelessWeb a development library for mobile Java (J2ME) devices. ReqwirelessWeb makes building mobile applications that fetch, POST, manipulate and display HTML content on any mobile Java device simple. Yes, that's HTML, so you can use those same Web pages you see on your desktop browser and those same CGI scripts on the backend. Simple indeed.
ReqwirelessWeb gives developers access to the real Web, making Web-based, mobile Java application development easy.
ReqwirelessWeb provides the viewing of HTML content, graphics, including GIF, JPEG, PNG, and BMP formats, cookies, forms, security via HTTPS (if supported by the device), basic authentication, HTTP, HTTPS, mailto, FTP, and gopher URLs, viewing of Microsoft Word documents and more in only 37k!
ReqwirelessWeb is device-agnostic, meaning it will automatically detect the capabilities of the mobile device and contour the experience for the device. Devices that support color see their images in color and devices with bigger screens see more of the web at once. One library, any device.
