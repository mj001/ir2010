Online Resources for Java Programmers
Online Resources for Java Programmers
The Web offers many resources
to help you use the Java platform.
This section lists some that we use ourselves,
or that we've heard good things about.
Caveat: A Web site that's good
one year might stagnate the next,
and it can be difficult to tell 
unless you know the site well.
Please
tell us
if any of these Web sites is obsolete,
or if you have a URL for an excellent resource not mentioned here.
We list three kinds of resources:
 General Programming Resources
 Web sites that provide information useful to most developers.
 Specialized Programming Resources
 Sources of more specialized programming information.
 Examples include assorted tutorials,
 The Swing Connection,
 and a Web site for Macintosh programmers.
 Other Resources
 Other stuff, such as the latest industry news.
Don't forget that the 
Tutorial has
many examples,
and that you can 
search the Tutorial.
Another source of resources is the
Additional Resources page on java.sun.com.
