Method Detail 
init
public void init()
 throws ServletException
The init method is called only when the servlet
 is first loaded, before the first request
 is processed.
Overrides:init in class GenericServlet
doGet
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
 HttpServletResponse response)
 throws ServletException,
 IOException
Overrides:doGet in class HttpServlet
getLastModified
public long getLastModified(HttpServletRequest request)
The standard service method compares this date
 against any date specified in the If-Modified-Since
 request header. If the getLastModified date is
 later, or if there is no If-Modified-Since header,
 the doGet method is called normally. But if the
 getLastModified date is the same or earlier,
 the service method sends back a 304 (Not Modified)
 response, and does not call doGet.
 The browser should used its cached version of
 the page in such a case.
Overrides:getLastModified in class HttpServlet
