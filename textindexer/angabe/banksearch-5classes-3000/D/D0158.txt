How to start programming Java applets?
Now it is time to take the Contact applet and make it your own. To start programming in Java you'll need to get the JDK 1.0.2 from JavaSoft. Follow the installation instructions for your particular hardware, found on the download page under the heading "How to Download the JDK", or here for Windows NT and Windows 95 platforms. Then use your favorite text editor to modify the Contact.java source code. You will compile the source using the command "javac Contact.java" which creates the bytecode in "Contact.class". You will also need to copy the Contact.html document in order to execute the Java applet.
Once you gain confidence with the Contact applet you will want some more examples of Java source code. One of the highly regarded reference books on Java programming is the O'Reilly & Associates book "Java in a Nutshell";
here are some examples from that book.
Conclusion
The Contact applet has introduced you to some of the Java statements, the Java objects and their methods. It has shown you how the browser controls the execution of the applet. It illustrates the simplicity and power of Java. Many say that Java's popularity is based on its "Write Once Run Anywhere(TM)" portability. However, the ability to easily write interactive graphical user interfaces, animation and interesting multimedia effects has also significantly added to its popularity with programmers around the world.
