Jini is defined as an infrastructure and programming model which allow devices to connect with each other to create an instant "community." Jini technology enables devices to work with each other, so users can create their own personal networks or communities no matter where they are located. Access your appliances at home or the office, or connect to your network while you're the road. That's Jini technology!
