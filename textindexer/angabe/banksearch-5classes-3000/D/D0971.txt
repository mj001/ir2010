Image Rollovers
 
 Have you ever been to a site where some
graphics change when you move your mouse in and out of them? I know I have!
These graphics are commonly referred to as image rollovers. All it takes to get
this cool effect is two images, and a little bit of JavaScript code. This
tutorial will teach you how to create rollovers that you can use for your own
site!
 For those of you who have never used
JavaScript before, JavaScript code goes in between the following
tags in an HTML document:
 All code for a little while will go in
between these tags. The first thing we need to do is make two image variables!
This is relatively simple. We will make images named coffee and coffee2. You can name yours whatever you want, just as long as you realize that you will have to change the variable names in the code below to get it to work. To make the images, I would put the following two lines in between the script tags (shown above).
var coffee=new Image();
var coffee2=new Image();
 There we go! Now we have two image
variables! However, we haven't assigned their source yet! We will make the
source of coffee be java.gif, and coffee2 be java2.gif, to keep it simple. To
set the source for the two variables we just made, add the two following lines
in between the script tags! (after the code you just typed to create the
variables).
coffee.src="java.gif";
coffee2.src="java2.gif";
 The src in the two lines
above simply means the source, so the two lines above set the sources of coffee
and coffee2! 
 We are now DONE in between the
script tags! The rest of the code will go in the link tags and image tags! Now
I will show you the rest of the code, then I will explain it! :)
 Okay, now here is the explanation. Set href
equal to whatever page you want the image to link to, just as you would with
any other link. The onMouseOver part tells your browser what to do when the
mouse comes into the area of the image. In this case, it is telling the browser
to make the source of the image named rollover equal to the source of coffee2.
This makes a different image take the place of the old image. The onMouseOut
part tells your browser what to do when the mouse leaves the area of the image.
In this case, it tells the browser to make the source of the image named
rollover equal to the source of coffee. This makes the original image reappear,
because the original source of rollover is the same gif file as the source of
coffee.
 The only thing unusual in the image tag
is that we named it rollover. This makes it possible to change its source using
onMouseOver and onMouseOut in the link tag. The image named rollover is the one
that will its source be changed. The line after the img tag simply
ands the link.
 The images along the left side of the page
that change are rollovers. If you want to see more example code, just view the
source of this document! :)
