Techniques for form editing
A tag library such as the one that comes with the Blazix
server, may not be available in your environment. How can you
allow similar features without using a tag library?
It is a little tedious, but it can be done. Basically, you must
edit each HTML tag yourself, and put in a default value. The following
examples shows how we modify GetName.jsp to provide features similar to
blx:getProperty
but with manual HTML tag editing:
What's your name? 
What's your e-mail address? 
What's your age? >
As you can see, this simply involves adding a "VALUE" field in the INPUT
tags, and initializing the field with an expression!
To handle exceptions during input processing, a simple approach is to
use "String" fields in the bean, and do the conversion to the
target datatype yourself. This will allow you to handle exceptions.
Exercise: Modify the earlier example to do everything without
the Blazix tag library (you can restrict this to only one field.)
