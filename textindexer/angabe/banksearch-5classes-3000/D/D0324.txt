Creating an Entity Bean: Blizzard Step 5
This brings us to the last page. Note that the names start off as
"PropsTable" and "propsTable" for the package name, and are edited here
to "Props" and "props".
Change the bean and package names to "Props" and "props", enter a directory
name, such as "C:\Ejbtut" where you want the entity bean source files to
be placed, and click "Build". You should see output similar to what
is shown below, in your Java console window.
The following entity bean source files have been created:
 Remote Interface: C:\Ejbtut\Props.java
 Home Interface: C:\Ejbtut\PropsHome.java
 Bean Class: C:\Ejbtut\PropsBean.java
The ejb-jar file has been created in:
 C:\Ejbtut\META-INF\ejb-jar.xml
The commands to build and compile the entity bean are in:
 C:\Ejbtut\build.cmd
[Press ENTER to continue]
