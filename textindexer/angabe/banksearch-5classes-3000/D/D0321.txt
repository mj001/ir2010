In an effort to better serve the J2ME community, Micro Java Network has updated its membership functionality. The updated functionality will provide you easier access to resources, tools, news and other J2ME information you need, plus it will give you new ways to interact with the community and contribute to MJN. NOTE: If you had registered on MJN prior to May 8, 2002, YOU MUST RE-REGISTER. We apologize for the inconvenience, but the new membership functionality requires a user name and password, which were not originally included.
