EJB Tutorial
 
Tutorial Overview
This tutorial teaches the EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) technology.
Prerequisites: The tutorial requires a good knowledge of
Java. The more advanced topics also require knowledge of JDBC. 
Access to a database is also required for many of the exercises (though
even without a database, the first few tutorial steps may be covered by
using the included MS/Acces file.)
Approach: This tutorial is meant for developers and is
completely designed to be "hands-on". The assumption is that
you will learn most by doing, not by reading. The tutorial is a guided
approach to doing things in a manner that will lead you into learning the
EJB concepts very quickly. For best progress, it is recommended that
you actually get all the examples working. By doing this, you will
gain familiarity with the actual practical issues. Also spend some
time on the exercises, these are designed to solidify your grasp of the
material.
