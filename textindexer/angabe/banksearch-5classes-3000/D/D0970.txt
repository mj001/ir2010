To guarantee you're looking at the latest version, 
we invite you to read the tutorial at its permanent home:
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/
You have several choices when downloading the tutorial:
- Download the online tutorial: This is the most popular option.
 When you download the online tutorial,
 you get everything that's in the java.sun.com version of the tutorial
 -- examples, HTML pages, images --
 the whole shebang.
- Download only the examples: You can download 
 a bundle that contains the source files 
 for all the tutorial examples.
- Download an individual example: 
 Some examples such as 
 the BINGO and Servlets Bookstore examples include many source files 
 in a rather complex directory structure,
 so we provide these examples as separate zip files.
- Download an individual trail:
 The JFC/Swing trail, as well as some old trails that 
 are no longer available online,
 can be downloaded individually.
 These trails may refer to files not included in the trail's bundle --
 files in other trails
 or files shared by all trails.
 Thus, the individually downloaded trails typically work best
 if placed alongside the other trails.
 If you place them elsewhere,
 you might notice some broken links and images,
 but you'll still be able to read the trails.
 
If you download any part of the tutorial, feel free to make it available
locally at your site. Please do not publicly mirror
it to the Web! Check our FAQ if you want to know
why.

FTP vs. HTTP:
 
FTP is generally your fastest option. 
We also offer an HTTP option in case you're behind a firewall 
and your local network does not allow FTP downloads.
Otherwise, there's no difference in the quality or content of 
the two download options--HTTP just might take longer. 
If you have trouble downloading the tutorial:
Try both the FTP and HTTP versions of the download.
If neither download method works,
please try again later.
If you still can't download,
ask your system administrator for help.
You might also find some relevant information on 
the 
Download Help page.
If you have trouble unarchiving the tutorial:
Make sure you have the latest software to unzip the tutorial. 
For example, PC users can use 
WinZip.
