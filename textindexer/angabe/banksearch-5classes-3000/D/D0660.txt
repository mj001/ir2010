Lesson: Writing a Simple Bean
In this section you will learn more about Beans and the
BeanBox by
 
- Creating a simple Bean
 
- Compiling and saving the Bean into a
 Java Archive (JAR) file
 
- Loading the Bean into the ToolBox
 
- Dropping a Bean instance into the BeanBox
 
- Inspecting the Bean's properties, methods, and events
 
- Generating an introspection report
Your Bean will be named SimpleBean.
Here are the steps to create it and view it in the BeanBox:
 
- Write the SimpleBean code. Put it in a file
 named SimpleBean.java, in the directory
 of your choice. Here's the code:
 
import java.awt.*;
import java.io.Serializable;
 
public class SimpleBean extends Canvas
 implements Serializable
{
 //Constructor sets inherited properties
 public SimpleBean(){
 setSize(60,40);
 setBackground(Color.red);
 }
}
 
SimpleBean extends the
java.awt.Canvas component.
SimpleBean also implements the
java.io.Serializable interface,
a requirement for all Beans. SimpleBean sets the background
color and component size.
 
 
- Make sure the CLASSPATH
 environment variable is set to point to all
 needed .class (or .jar) files. Here
 are some URLs that will help you to set CLASSPATH correctly:
 
 
- The
 
Managing Source and Class Files lesson gives good advice on how and when to set your CLASSPATH.
 
- The JDK Tool Reference Page provides complete CLASSPATH information for both
 
Windows and 
Solaris platforms.
 
 
 
- Compile the Bean:
 
 javac SimpleBean.java
 
 This produces the class file SimpleBean.class
 
 
- Create a manifest file. Use your favorite text editor
 to create a file, we'll call it manifest.tmp,
 that contains the following text:
 
 Name: SimpleBean.class
 Java-Bean: True
 
 
- Create the JAR file. The JAR file will contain the
 manifest and the SimpleBean class file:
 
 jar cfm SimpleBean.jar manifest.tmp SimpleBean.class
 
 See the 
JAR Files trail, and the 
JDK JAR file documentation for complete information on JAR files. 
- Load the JAR file into the ToolBox. Select
 the File|LoadJar... menu item. This will bring up a
 file browser. Navigate to the SimpleBean.jar location and
 select it. SimpleBean will appear at the bottom
 of the ToolBox. (Note that when the BeanBox is
 started, all Beans in JAR files in the
 beans/jars directory are automatically
 loaded into the ToolBox).
 
- Drop a SimpleBean instance into the BeanBox.
 Click on the word SimpleBean in the ToolBox. The cursor
 will change to a crosshair. Move the cursor to a spot within the
 BeanBox and click. SimpleBean will appear as a
 painted rectangle with a hatched border. This border means
 that SimpleBean is selected. The
 SimpleBean properties will appear in the
 Properties sheet.
 
You can resize SimpleBean, because it inherits from
Canvas, by dragging a corner. You will see the cursor
change to a right angle when over a corner. You can also reposition
SimpleBean within the BeanBox by dragging on any non-corner
portion of the hatched border. You will see the cursor change to crossed
arrows when in position to move the Bean.
SimpleBean Makefiles
Below are two makefiles (Unix and Windows) set up to
create SimpleBean.
# gnumake file
CLASSFILES= SimpleBean.class
JARFILE= SimpleBean.jar
all: $(JARFILE)
# Create a JAR file with a suitable manifest.
$(JARFILE): $(CLASSFILES) $(DATAFILES)
 echo "Name: SimpleBean.class" >> manifest.tmp
 echo "Java-Bean: True" >> manifest.tmp
 jar cfm $(JARFILE) manifest.tmp *.class
 @/bin/rm manifest.tmp
# Compile the sources
%.class: %.java
 export CLASSPATH; CLASSPATH=. ; \
 javac $bean information
 class that explicitly describes your Bean's features.
You can generate a Bean introspection report
by choosing the the Edit|Report menu item. The
report lists Bean events, properties, and methods,
and their characteristics.
By default Bean reports are sent
to the java interpreter's standard output, which is the window
where you started the BeanBox. You can redirect the
report to a file by changing the java interpreter
command in beanbox/run.sh or
run.bat to:
java sun.beanbox.BeanBoxFrame > beanreport.txt
