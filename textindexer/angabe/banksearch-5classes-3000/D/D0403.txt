 Because it is a viral license and commercial companies tend to shy away from them.

 Even Microsoft is caving in to Open Source (a little bit)

 Here's a nice piece from the MS mouthpiece site describing how Open Source and Java (again OPEN SOURCE _AND_ JAVA) forced them to open their stuff (right, not comparable at all to what Sun has done in the past and is doing now).
http://www.msnbc.com/news/730195.asp?cp1=1
I considered it fitting for the mouthpiece site I am posting it on.

 Does this mean that OS Projects like JBoss,Log4J etc. get more visibility into the enterprsie world as safe-to-use products. I guess Log4J is not going to make it as 1.4 is out any way and they've lost the battle.

 Your link is bad. 
In any case, Microsoft's "shared source" program is, if anything, slightly better than Sun's. Neither company lets you use the code from them commercially and hence neither is open source compliant. Both companies will listen to your input. But, unlike Sun, Microsoft explicitly disclaims contamination in their license.
Neither company is "caving in" to open source; these are marketing plays for mindshare. But as far as marketing goes, Microsoft's shared source license seems a bit more benign. I can imagine letting students look at Microsoft's source code; given Sun's license, letting students look at Sun's source code would be a career limiting move for them and would be irresponsible.

 The original link on msnbc has disappeared. The article was really positive on open source and its powers. 
http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-03-29-013-26-NW-CY-MS
And yes, Microsoft is caving in. I wish they were really smashed by open source, but this may take a while.

 As far as I can tell, when somebody can make his own TCK (test compatibility kit) he could theoretically also certify a J2EE implementation, i.e. there could be an independently certified JBoss.

 JBoss says "too little too late!"

I talked to Mark Fluery of JBoss Group at the JBossOne conference that was going on at the same time as JavaOne and asked him what he thought of the announcement that morning.
His response: "Too little too late"
JBoss doesn't want to be some poor open source cousin who gets some lesser certification. They have the money and want to pay for the full commercial certification and are in negotiations to close that deal.
My feeling is that they're not particularly grateful and that they feel that SUN was stringing the JBoss community along. Naturally, it's to protect SUN's revenue stream from BEA, Oracle, HP and IBM. However, if SUN promises a universal language that can accomplish the goal of write once and run anywhere, then reneges on allowing people to actually achieve those goals, then I don't blame them for not being particularly grateful when SUN finally makes it just partially possible to do what they promised in the first place.

 Somebody is developing an open source application AND is even paying to get it certified, for giving it away.
Now, I am sure that the JBoss people are no fools. They must be sure how to recoup their investment.
If this doesn't prove once again that open source is a viable business proposition, I don't know what is.
Anybody having a different interpretation?
Bernard
