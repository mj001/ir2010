Story:
If you are looking for a good book on developing J2EE applications, you should check out Professional Java Server Programming, J2EE Edition.
This is an outstanding book. Of course, I'm biased, because I'm one of the authors. I wrote chapter 16, An XML-Based JDBC Connector Servlet Framework. Check it out, and let me know what you think.
