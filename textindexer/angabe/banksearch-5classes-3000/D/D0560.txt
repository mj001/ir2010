Have you ever wondered what kind of 
HTTP server software a particular Web site is running? Now you can find 
out with Hoskinson's Web server query tool. This tool is written 
completely in Java, and will run in any JDK 1.1 - compliant VM. I have 
tested it using the Sun JDK 1.2, and the Microsoft VM Build 
5.00.3167.
How does this tool 
work?
First, this tool confirms the identity 
of the host by doing a name server lookup. Second, it attempts to connect 
to an HTTP daemon running on port 80. If successful, it gets the HTTP 
"Server" header (which is the name of the Web server software), and displays 
it to the end user. 
If the server in question is running 
HTTP on another port, you can still query it using this tool. Simply 
append the port number to the host name (separated by a ":"), as shown 
below:
If you are interested in using this 
tool, read both the disclaimer and the license, and then download the tool and the source code. If you are a Java 2 user (JDK 1.2.x), you can download 
an executable JAR version, and if you are a Microsoft VM user, you can 
download a Win32 EXE version. To run it, execute one of the 
following commands:
Sun 
JDK:
java qryHTTPd
---- or ----
javaw qryHTTPd
Microsoft 
VM:
jview qryHTTPd
---- or ----
wjview qryHTTPd
