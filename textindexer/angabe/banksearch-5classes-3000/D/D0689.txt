To throw this out there: I love it when people listen to my music and think of it as contemporary, as I know the "true" contemporary artists know that it is not exactly cutting edge. I believe composers who are out there trying not to mimic the past need a place to outlet. A filtered down joint. I think this might be it. Quite fitting that Jeff would come up with it, eh?

Thanks, James, I hope this could become something like that. I was going to start a few new categories, something like New Music in General and Announce...

I just finished a short (but kind of dense) essay on this. It's up at the Kalvos and Damian website, here:

 Very interesting essay. Really made me think. Striving for originality is something I've always pondered. I sometimes felt like I got too caught up with it. Locally my more progressive music met with really harsh criticism. They said it attacks the listener, and my traditional style was well recieved. Odd when I put my progressive music online it was well recieved, and my more traditional music was lambasted!
Anymore I just write for myself without worrying too much about originality. I just try to make it interesting no matter what style I choose. 
Again Steve thanks for the link to this interesting essay.

Good essay, Steve. Was it James Tenney who said something like it's hard to make a revolution when two revolutions ago they already declared that anything goes? If what you're talking about isn't post-modernism, maybe it's "(post-)*n modernism," where n = as many "post's" as it takes to remove self-conscious irony. 
While most of the essay is about the idea that there's no longer the same kind of pressure or even clear direction to "advance," early on you still recognize the value placed on originality. I don't think this is really a contradiction; I think it's possible to form an original voice without "inventing a new game." But maybe there's space to explore there for another essay, or at least a BB conversation.
