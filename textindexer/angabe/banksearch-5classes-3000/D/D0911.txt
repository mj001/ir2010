 THIS WEEKS ARTICLE: Rounded Rectangles
------------------------------------------------------------
	The Graphics class is really great. It lets us draw circles,
rectangles, lines, text, and some other cool stuff. The Graphics
class also has a method which allows you to draw rounded
rectangles. (i.e. rectangles with curves instead of sharp
corners.) Here is the basic format for the method, assuming
that the name of your Graphics class is g:
g.fillRoundRect(x,y,width,height,arcwidth,archeight);
	In the format above, replace x with the the x coordinate
of the upper left corner of the rectangle. Replace y with
the y coordinate of the upper left corner of the triangle.
Replace width with the number of pixels wide you want your
triangle to be, and replace height with the number of
pixels tall that you want your rectangle to be.
	As I said before, the corners of the the rectangle can
be made into curves instead of sharp corners. Think of each
curve just as a simple arc. You need to tell the computer how
tall and wide to make your arc. Replace arcwidth the width
the you want your arc to be in pixels, and archeight with the
number of pixels tall you want your arc to be. These two
numbers in the method tell the computer how much of a curve
you want on each corner. 
	As I said, the fillRoundRect() method is part of the
Graphics class. Most often you use the method inside the
paint or update method. If you don't want your rounded 
rectangle to be filled, but merely an outline, do everything
the same, except use "drawRoundRect" in place of "fillRoundRect".
