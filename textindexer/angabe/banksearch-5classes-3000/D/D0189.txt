(About the author) 
 
 
 Pipebost is a content compression product that dynamically compresses content served out by your IIS server before it gets to the browser. This dramatically reduces the time it takes the document to load in the user's browser as well as cuts down on bandwidth usage. For example, PipeBoost has reduced the bandwidth usage on PlanetSourceCode.com by a whopping 27% --which is basically an entire T1! And the .asp pages load much quicker...about 50% faster than before. The slower your connection the more you notice PipeBoost.

How does it work?
 
    How does 
 it work?  If you think about it the .htm, .asp, etc. files being served by 
 IIS are not very efficient...they are basically bulky text files.  If you 
 could compress them before sending them out, your download times would be 
 greatly shortened. 
 
   I didn't know 
 this before, but the HTTP 1.1 standard actually already includes support for 
 this sort of compression.  This standard is supported in 95% of 
 browsers...IE4.0+, Netscape 4.0+ and Opera 4.0+). However, you do need the right 
 software on your internet server to recognize the browser and serve it out 
 compressed content...and most servers don't have this.
 
    Microsoft 
 included such a feature in IIS...but if you've used it, you know that it's a 
 little buggy and it only works on static HTM pages...not your dynamic ASP pages.
 
    That's 
 where PipeBoost comes into play.  It can compress content on the fly and 
 serve it to the browser, which un-compresses it and displays it.  It is so 
 simple to implement...you just run a short 3 minute install program and its 
 ready to go...no configuration required on either the server or the browser (of 
 course if you want to get fancy you can tweak the server GUI for hours...but for 
 most installations the default install will be more than adequate).
 
Test Results
 
    
 Before rolling out PipeBoost, I tested it in the lab.  I 
 downloaded the trial version and installed it on a server here in Tampa, 
 Florida.  Then I put a test 9.12 Mb Excel Spreadsheet in a test directory 
 and downloaded it from a browser located in Boston, Mass.  (this was done 
 via terminal server) and measured the results.
 
    The 
 improvement was eye-popping.

 Difference: 
   
 3.7 x speed increase 
 
 
 
    After rolling it into 
 production, I immediately saw a 27% decrease in bandwidth usage...or about an 
 entire T1 worth of data.  Planet Source Code actually has alot more 
 compressed .zip files than most sites do (which of course can't be further 
 compressed by PipeBoost), so most sites should see an even larger decrease in 
 bandwidth.
 
Trying it on your own
 
 
    
 PipeBoost has a great tool 
 on their web site that lets you test their product on your own web site, without 
 having to install it...to get an idea of how much it can compress your content 
 and save you.  Just go to PipeBoost and click on "Request Report" and then 
 type in your URL.  The Planet Source Code home page showed that it could be 
 compressed 73%!
 
My Conclusion
 
 
    This is one of the few 'must 
 have' products for IIS.  I your website does anything more than trivial 
 traffic, you should seriously 
 consider this program.  To download this program , go to
 PipeBoost and click on 
 'Downloads'.

Marc,
 Sorry if I didn't make it clear enough from my review that you were mislead. Let me clarify...if you're running a personal web site on your home machine, this product is not for you. However, I do recommend it for anyone running a site that takes up at least 1 T1 worth of bandwidth as it will pay for itself within a month.

This uses the same technology as the GZip module for apache. In all actuallity with the right C++ plugin made for IIS. In fact.. Even a Visual Basic plugin made to interface with IIS could do this. How do I know... because you can intercept all buffer output by IIS and then compress it. After you do that you modify the context-type that is sent back to the browser as the compressed type. Of course you would want to check the Agent to make certain it supports this. If not then you don't buffer the output from the server request. If so then you do.
My company had me implement something like this with apache using something similar to the mod for Apache but with some slight modificationsKeep the Planet clean! If this comment was disrespectful, please report it:

Elliot, sound's like you never in your life done any programming for IIS at all. First, there is not way you can intercept IIS calls easily, expect writing an ISAPI filter. And you should know, that they can't write ISAPI filter in Visual Basic at all. There is a technique of developing ISAPI filters in VB, by using Desaware.com (Spyworks). This will make performance terrible. I understand jealousy of people when see real quality product. Usually they think "I could write the same thing and make so much money". Development of the same application for Apache is almost no brainier. You have to just take source code of mod_gizp (Open Source) and modify it a little bit if you want to. Apache and IIS absolutely 2 incomparable differences. There is no way to do it in VB. Period. Please try not to advise anything without deep knowledge of the issue.Keep the Planet clean!

AndrComm,
 FYI, there's a difference between programming an ISAPI application(which is what the link you just posted shows how to do) and an ISAPI FILTER, like Pipeboost. An ISAPI app basically returns web content, while a filter sits on top of something like ASP and filters content. An ISAPI application can be done in VB, but as far as I know, an ISAPI filter cannot (with the exception mentioned above by alik996, of Spyworks) be written in VB. Then to further complicate matters further...in VB.NET, it will be possible to create ISAPI filters for ASP.NET applications.Keep the Planet clean!

AndrComm, Key difference between ISAPI Filter and ISAPI Extension that is ISAPI Filter is being executed on EVERY ACCESS to the web server. No matter this is an ASP script, image or anything else. Just think about performance of your web server, when you have to parse strings and data streams in VB on EVERY REQUEST and RESPONSE. VB is still macro language, and it can&#8217;t come even closer to power of C++. Implementation of this scenario will limit power of your IIS to 1 executed thread at the time. Answer is very simple, it&#8217;s impossible to implement ISAPI filter in VB with same efficiency as in C++. Period.Keep the Planet clean! If this comment was disrespectful, please report it:

alik996, I am willing to admit that I posted a bit hasty... but after checking back with this conversation noted you made the comment "VB is still macro language" after telling me that I need to "Please try not to advise anything without deep knowledge of the issue". I believe that you have been found guilty of the same thing with which you have accused me of. Yes Visual Basic does require the runtime dynamic linked library for some codebase. But it is not a 'macro' language. It used to be and still can be compiled into pseudo code which used tokens for code. However, since VB5, Visual Basic supports native compilation which means that Visual Basic compiles into native machine code.Keep the Planet clean!

'Implementation of this scenario will limit power of your IIS to 1 executed thread at the time. Answer is very simple, it&#8217;s impossible to implement ISAPI filter in VB with same efficiency as in C++. Period.'
This isn't true. While VB Classes are STA objects that doesn't nto mean your Filter will limit IIS to a single thread of execution unless YOU, the PROGRAMMER cause that to happen through crappy design.
The real programmer would use COM+ for object pooling, this would be considerably more efficient than instancing objects you need on every page access.
Also with something like vbExport you're not living within a single object, you're living within a DLL that has exports, just like C allows.

Win32 is Win32 and pointers are pointers, regardless if the language is VB or C. From that perspective, you can come down to C/C++ equivalent speeds in string manipulation using VB. Marginal at worst, meaning that for 1 million iterations of processing you might lose 2-4 seconds. I know this because in 2000 a group of us spent 3-4 weeks benchmarking alternative string algorithms within VB, C, Delphi and Assembler. With a base processing time of 5 seconds (this is iterative, fill and spill cycles and similar), ASM (highly optimized) modules acheived ~400-600ms for 5mb of string data. C acheived <!xmp>Wilson<!/xmp>
The last thing I wanted to point out here was that the guy who said ISAPI was possible in VB was not incorrect. And while it may not be your personal choice in programming a solution, don't sit here and beat a man down because you don't fully understand a solution yourself.
If you don't agree, that's fine. Everyone has opinion, but you're out of place trying to convince everyone who reads tehse posts that such work is impossible and largely inconcievable using VB.
It's not. You just lack the experience to make it happen the way it should. Unfortunately 60% of the 'VB developers' out there are just like that, will probably write fundamentall loathesome code that largely underperforms a C/C++ (or even Java) equivalent.
You can't blame the platform or the languages, it's the programmers...

I don't agree to guys who say VB is slow and not a solution for speed programming. I currently develop a 3D Engine in VB, the only speed hole in the Engine is Windows itself. If you have a target and you know how to do it in VB then sometimes u will be able to win against C++.
An example, I wrote a Setup in VB, but as I compared it with a C++-Setup, like Microsoft's Install Shield, my was the faster one in copying files (hurray :-).
These my last words: Ian, keep smiling, the only thing you did is that you speed up PSC which million of programmers use with slow modems.
PS: To alik996 who said VB is a macro language. VBA, included in MS Office Appz, is a macro language, but not the native VB. VB has a native compiler, and that's a great difference to VBA.

Pretty ungrateful guy, Falko....A million 56kbps modems got sped up from 32kbps to 51kbps and you're not happy! Just kidding, because I assume you are too! ;)
Anyway, I think Alik is talking about older versions of VB (i.e. VB 5.0 and before). VB 6.0 compiles using the same native compiler as C/C++ and of course in VB.NET the end result is virtually indistinguishable from C++ or C#.
