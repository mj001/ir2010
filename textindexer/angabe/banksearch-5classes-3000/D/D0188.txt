Professional XML Databases
 
Wednesday, December 20, 2000
Submitted by Andy Hoskinson
Story Summary:
If you are looking for a good book on developing XML-enabled database applications, you should check out Professional XML Databases.
This is an outstanding book. Of course, I'm biased, because I'm one of the authors. I wrote chapter 16, JDBC. In this chapter, I walk through how to develop an XML Gateway Architecture for JDBC. I also discuss how to use XML to create distributed JDBC applications using the javax.sql.Rowset interface and the WebRowSet class. Check it out, and let me know what you think.
