Trail: JavaBeans(TM)
by Andy Quinn
JavaBeans brings component technology to the Java
platform.
With the JavaBeans API you can
create reuseable, platform-independent components. Using
JavaBeans-compliant application builder tools,
you can combine these components into applets,
applications, or composite components.
JavaBean components are known as Beans.
JavaBeans is a core JDK1.1 capability. Any JDK1.1-compliant
browser or tool implicitly supports JavaBeans. 
This document is a hands-on guide to learning JavaBeans and
the Beans Development Kit (BDK).
The 
JavaBeans API Specification provides a complete JavaBeans description.Print out a copy of the JavaBeans specification, and keep it
handy when going through this document.
The BDK is available free on the web.
In addition to the 
BDK , you will need the 
Java Development Kit (JDK).
JavaBeans Concepts and the Beans Development Kit
describes what makes a Bean, and describes the
Beans Development Kit (BDK).
Using the BeanBox describes basic BeanBox
operation, and explains the BeanBox menus.
Writing a Simple Bean walks you through creating
a rudimentary Bean, saving the Bean, adding the Bean to the ToolBox,
placing the Bean in the BeanBox, inspecting the Bean's properties and
events, and generating a Bean introspection report.
Properties explains how to give your Beans properties:
Bean appearance and behavior characteristics customizable at design time.
Manipulating Events in the BeanBox describes the
BeanBox's event manipulating capabilities. If you are not familiar 
with event handling, you might want to read up on
Event Handling to prepare for this material.
The BeanInfo Interface describes how to
write Bean information classes: Separate classes you can use to explicitly
advertise your Bean's properties, methods, and events to builder tools.
Bean Customization introduces you to property
editors, and the Customizer interface.
Bean Persistence explains how to save and retore
your Beans, and their customized state.
Using the BeanContext API 
is a NEW
lesson by
Scott Hommel
that covers
The Extensible Runtime Containment and Services Protocol,
also known as beancontext.
New Features lists upcoming BDK and 
Beans-related features.
Additional Documentation
The BDK's beans/docs directory
contains documentation for
 
- The Beans API
 
- The BeanBox API
 
- The demo Beans
 
- The java.util API
 
- Java Archive (JAR) files and manifests
 
- Makefiles for gnumake (Unix) and nmake (Windows)
A good starting point is the file beans/README.html.
The 
JavaBeans Documentation page contains current JavaBeans API definitions,
upcoming JavaBeans feature descriptions,
and related Java documentation such as the
Java Core Reflection API, Object
Serialization, Remote Method
Invocation (RMI), and a 
third-party JavaBeans book list.
