I've added a new "block" to the portal left side, "Top Week's Composers". I put a couple of our links in to see how it's going to work. 
How should news and news article submissions be treated? You guys read SlashDot.org? 
http://www.slashdot.org
This is the portal approach, that PostNuke seems to be emulating. I kind of like the news vs. forum approach. Might produce a more informal commentary, less forum-y type of writing.

This may be a dumb question, but isn't slashcode open source? But I think it's perl rather than php.
On another note, I think you've found the "Cowboy Neal" of new music with "BORING PRETENTIOUS CRAP!"

Slashdot is PHP/MySQL now. The source is available but its very frozen - a new site would look pretty much like the Slashdot.
BORING PRETENTIOUS CRAP indeed!
It is true the the fridge has to be unplugged for us, though... shhhhh...
