About the Articles Section 
 
Through the course of learning Java, the beginner often comes up with some problems that they cannot solve
or questions that they cannot answer. Many sites use FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) documents to answer these
questions. Most of the time, however, the answers are brief and not well explained. For now, the purpose of
the Articles section is to discuss common problems that occur among beginners and to answer any questions you may
have that need more in depth answers than the forums can provide. To request an
article, type your request in the box at the right, then click on the "Make
Request" button.
