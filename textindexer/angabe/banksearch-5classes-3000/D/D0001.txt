1)Common Dialog API calls
Category: Windows API Call/ Explanation
Level: Unknown
Description: Here are the Windows API calls for the ShowOpen, ShowSave,
ShowPrinter, ShowColor and ShowFont (Thanks to Jaen Saul aka SlowByte for his post) dialogs. Also included is the beginnings of the ShowFonts dialog but I am having some trouble getting it to work. These calls are more difficult to use than the CommonDialog control placed on a form, but don't have the version conflicts that Early-Bound and Form-Bound ActiveX controls have. In addition, I have added the ability to center the dialog on the form or center it on the screen.
