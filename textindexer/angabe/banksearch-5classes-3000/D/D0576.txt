What is the Java Virtual Machine?
The JVM is the software that executes Java bytecode.
A Java program, written in a file with a .java
extension, is compiled into class files that have a
.class extension. The class files are
written in bytecode. To execute these files, the computer
uses the JVM to interpret the bytecode.
A browser that is
capable of executing Java applets has the JVM built
into it. To run a Java application, the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) must be installed. The JRE contains
the files in the Java Development Kit minus the
development tools, only the files necessary to run a
Java application are present.
The bytecode is the same for all
platforms, but the JVM will be different on different
platforms because it needs to execute programs using the
native code of the machine it is running on.

I highly recommend
Beginning Java 2 - JDK 1.3 Edition
by Ivor Horton. Don't let the title fool you. The book
is written with such detail that it is good for beginners
and advanced programmers. Ivor Horton's books are some of the best
Java books I've ever used. I always refer people having
troubles with Java to them. Recent feedback I've gotten
from people using the Java 2, JDK 1.3 edition is excellent!
Based on my recommendation, a friend purchased this book.
He has thanked me several times because it has helped him
understand the things he was having a hard time with for
so long. You know the types of things I mean, those
nagging ideas and details that you thought you would never
be able to understand. Ivor is very clear to me. Try it,
you'll like it!
Check out a popular Java book about Java style and best practices,
The Elements of Java Style.
As you know, it's not enough just to make it work. HOW
you make it work and look is even more important. How
many times have you been told, "Yes, it works, but that
doesn't look like Java should" or "You shouldn't do it that
way." This book is about writing high-quality code.
