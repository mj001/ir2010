 3DME - 3D / Vocal Massage 
 
 
 Posted by civax on Monday, July 08 @ 14:57:42 CEST (79 reads) ) 
	 
	 We're starting to see some advances in the IM programs, finally going towards the VISUAL (and vocal) direction. 3DME is an Israeli-American company producing talking characters as your IM agents. You can use smilies in the body of the text and it will cause the character you're using to actually make that impression... A good option that should be added is allowing only a small box for text writing to be opened and disappear after writing your text. This way you can actually TALK (instead of read/write) with your partner while you continue working. 
Anyway, check it out here.

 48-Hour Game Programming Competition - July 12-14 
 
 
 Posted by thoooms on Tuesday, June 25 @ 15:40:26 CEST (219 reads) ) 
	 
	 Ludum Dare's second game programming competition is officially scheduled and coming up.
The competition focuses on making the best gameplay experience under a common theme with 1-person teams, doing it "mostly from scratch".
Beyond a basic library to keep you from being bogged down with OS wrapping implementation details, the programs and content must be made entirely within the allotted time.
For full details go to the official announcement page:
http://ludumdare.com/articles/?link=v&arid=32
To see the final entries from the last 24-Hour Game Programming Competition with the theme of "Indirect Interaction" head here:
http://ludumdare.com/competition/index.php?viewcomp=1
Everyone had a lot of fun last time, so we hope there can be more people to enjoy it with us this one!
