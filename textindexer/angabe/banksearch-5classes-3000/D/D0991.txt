Java Server Pages Information 
 
Written By: Gangavarapu Suresh
What is JavaServer Pages technology? 
JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology 
provides a simplified, fast way to create web pages that display dynamically 
generated content. The JSP specification, developed through an industry-wide 
initiative led by Sun Microsystems, defines the interaction between the 
server and the JSP page, and describes the format and syntax of the page. 
 
What is a servlet? 
A servlet is a program written in the Java programming 
language that runs on the server, as opposed to the browser (applets). 
Why do I need JSP technology if I already 
have Servlets? 
JSP pages are compiled into Servlets, so theoretically you 
could write servlets to support your web-based applications. However, JSP 
technology was designed to simplify the process of creating pages by separating 
web presentation from web content. In many applications, the response sent 
to the client is a combination of template data and dynamically generated 
data. In this situation, it is much easier to work with JSP pages than to 
do everything with servlets. 
What is a JSP page? 
A JSP page is a page 
created by the web developer that includes JSP technology-specific tags, 
declarations, and possibly scriptlets, in combination with other static 
(HTML or XML) tags. A JSP page has the extension .jsp; this signals to the 
web server that the JSP engine will process elements on this page. The exact 
format of a JSP page is described in the JSP specification.
How do JSP pages work? 
A JSP engine interprets tags and scriptlets, and 
generates the content required - for example, by calling a bean, accessing 
a database with the JDBCTM API or including a file. It then sends the results 
back in the form of an HTML (or XML) page to the browser. The logic that 
generates the content is encapsulated in tags and beans processed on the 
server. JSP scriptlets let developers tie everything together, and ordinary 
HTML tags control the formatting and display of the generated page. 
Does 
JSP technology require the use of other Java platform APIs? 
JSP pages are 
typically compiled into Java platform servlet classes. As a result, JSP 
pages require a Java virtual machine that supports the Java platform servlet 
specification. 
How is a JSP page invoked and compiled? 
Pages built using 
JSP technology are typically implemented using a translation phase that 
is performed once, the first time the page is called. The page is compiled 
into a Java Servlet class and remains in server memory, so subsequent calls 
to the page have very fast response times. 
What scripting languages can 
I use with JSP technology? 
Some JSP engines may support other languages, 
but the JSP 1.1 specification only specifies a scripting language based 
on the Java programming language. 
How do I use JavaBeans components 
(beans) from a JSP page? 
The JSP specification includes standard tags for 
bean use and manipulation. The useBean tag creates an instance of a specific 
JavaBeans class. If the instance already exists, it is retrieved. Otherwise, 
it is created. The setProperty and getProperty tags let you manipulate properties 
of the given object. These tags are described in more detail in the JSP 
specification and tutorial.
