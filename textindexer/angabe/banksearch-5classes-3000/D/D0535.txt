This is harder than I thought--interesting composers/performers don't always have interesting web sites. I'll assemble a list anyway, Jeff, I'm sure you'll have no trouble throwing sites out.
Kalvos, not sure whether you were looking for suggestions, but I've got a couple: RTQE is the local "non-pop" show, and Mappings might work too, though Internet-only.

The main thing, I'd like to see from this is interesting music. Basically who are the most interesting composers promoting and distributing their music online with complete pieces available for listening?
If you'll look at the portal prototype I got up last night, you'll see that you can add resources. (Please don't start using the portal yet, btw). If you've got a lot, that would be a pain to input over a web app interface. Please email me.
One thing I'd like you guys (everyone) to comment on is this. How do you present a small group of composers so that this list doesn't become another unusable too long resource in itself. 
1. You present a randomized - changed with each session? - list of 20.
2. You alphabetically list the 100 or so that all you guys come up with.
3. You have a monthly feature (weekly?) of this month's featured composers/performers.
Other concepts? 
I'm leaning towards a monthly or weekly feature concept. Except that seems to me to imply that there's going to be some lousy links. I would like to get across that this list really is the creme de la creme...

Haha,
And I thought this topic was related to your Parnasse discussion forum. Nevermind my initial post then. I have thought (although not inclined to do) that it would be a good idea to have a collaboration of strictly composers at first entitled something like "modern classical" at a site similar to Javamusic. If anything, it might motivate performers to learn contemporary works and perform to get on this site. ??? Amature performers should realize that to get their voice out in real way would be to perform modern works. Otherwise, they will be a dead voice in a sea of the super-virtuoso. They should understand that one will not go out and buy their CD, when they have a major label to buy from with someone who can 32nd note us to death on the left up the register with trills moving slowly up the right. But, let the amature do good with a contemporary work and it could perhaps leave a mark in history.

You're right, James, we're confusing the Classical MP3 Portal with the NewNewMusic forum. I'm not sure what resources David's going to be sending me... was maybe assuming incorrectly that they'd be new music-related.
The approach I suggest up there would work fine, I believe with classical performers. 
I had another idea just now, too... 
4. Guest favorites. Give members (whatever that ends up meaning) a shot at suggesting their favorite MP3-providers for a week; ordered as they see fit. 
I'm a bit focussed on that right now, only because software installation is a little hairy and I got a portal up - the new music one. 
I'll probably try and put up the Classical MP3 portal tonight and re-focus the discussion. 
You're right on about amateurs and getting them interested in performing new music, btw... how can we promote that?
BTW, please check out my portal (not the new music forum - something new):
http://netnewmusic.net/www/html
It's going to be very very cool I think...

Features would be just fine, except that it implies working up a "real" profile & etc. every few weeks. I just have a feeling that nobody here's in the magazine biz. Personally I like the random auto "short list", though I'd keep it to around ten only, with another link someplace to the full alphabetical list. This keeps something on the page a little fresh on every visit, without even trying. It still leaves room for the addition of things like features and etc., too.

Yeah, I want to simulate lots of curated content while actually doing almost no work!

I'm going to dupe off NetNewMusic and change the logo and call it the Classical MP3 Portal. I'm thinking about writing a spider to walk the Classical Music News site (LSIM?) and get the URL's to use for a daily off-site newsfeed. Just list the headlines and ask for comments. 
I'm not going to randomize the Classical MP3 URL's but instead add a ranking column so that my "experts" can push or pull artists up and down the charts. 
Main thing is to get people to the best music. Get them excited about the completeness of the classical listening experience now available online. And get them away from BS classical, dilutions of the music they're looking for. Then start creating a community with news and commentary expected of the users.

David, what I'm looking for is the top notch artists that are using the web for distribution and not just teasers to CD sales. That's what the audience wants. Folks are looking for music online, complete pieces and for artists that are using the net to promote their music.
