Warning: Your browser is not Java-capable
This applet is a simple text animation that displays a 
string which switches between four different colors at a user-specified time 
interval. If you click on the applet container, it stops the animation. 
 Clicking on it again restarts it.
This 
is what the mark-up looks like to implement the rainbow text applet in your HTML 
page (Note: this assumes that rainbow_text_andyhosk.class is in the same directory as 
it's parent HTML page). The parameters, by the way, correspond to the instance 
that is running on this page right now:

Background and Foreground Color Attributes
Most people will find the six basic colors
sufficient. However, you can set the background or foreground
color of the applet to any one of the 16+ million colors in the
24 bit RGB (Red-Green-Blue) spectrum. But first, you must
calculate the value of your custom color. To facilitate this,
please use this calculator.
