This stand-alone application shows how to implement a simple text editor in Java 1.1.
 It demos the following principles: 
- 
 Creating a windowed application by extending java.awt.Frame
- 
 Creating a menu bar, and attaching it to the frame
- 
 Creating an "action event" handler by implementing the ActionListener interface.
 Using this model, event handling is "delegated" to the one or more EventListeners 
 that are "listening" for events to occur to a given component. Event Listeners are 
 classes that implement the interfaces in the EventListener interface hierarchy.
 An EventListener can be a separate class, or it can be an EventListener for it's
 own components.
- 
 "Explicit Event Enabling" as an alternative to delegating event handling to
 listeners. This is accomplished by overriding the "process event" method that receives events and
 dispatches them to event listeners.
- 
 Using the java.io.File class to get information about a file or directory
- 
 Using and chaining low level and high level input and output streams
If you are interested, read both the disclaimer and the license, and then download the bytecode file and the 
source code. If you are a Java 2 user (JDK 1.2.x), you can download 
an executable JAR version. To run it, execute one of the 
following commands:
Sun 
JDK:
java simpleTextEditor
---- or ----
javaw simpleTextEditor
Microsoft 
VM:
jview simpleTextEditor
---- or ----
wjview simpleTextEditor
