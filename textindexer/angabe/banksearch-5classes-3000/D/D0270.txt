Further learning
The JSP tutorial presented here covers the most useful JSP programming
constructs. The tutorial is focused on being practical and simple,
therefore not all details have been covered.
Specifications
When you are comfortable with JSPs and ready to tackle more details, you
may find it useful to download the JSP specifications from Sun's
JSP page. There is also a JSP
quick reference card available from this site that can be handy to
print out and keep.
An item to note is that JSP's eventually are turned into servlets, and
though JSPs are much simpler than servlets, for some cases servlets are
still useful. Therefore you may want to also learn about servlets.
Interface Definitions
If you need to know exactly how to do some particular thing in JSP, e.g.
how to get the remote user's machine name, or the query string, or how
to re-direct the user's browser to a different page, or some similar thing,
one good place to start looking is in these interface definitions:
javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest
javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse
javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter
javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext
