 I have yet to see any open-source advocate thank Sun for changing their position. No one seems to be interested in thanking Sun for the millions of dollars worth of free support they've pledged either.Have I missed all the articles with public "Thank You Sun" messages?Where are the articles from prominent people in the open source movement that say:"With this latest change, Java is now Open Enough. Even though there's always room for improvement, we're satisfied. Unless something changes, you'll hear no more complaining from us."If the open-source crowd are serious people, now is the time to show it. If all they can do is complain, then why should anyone (Sun, or anyone else) listen to them? What good does it do?

 You took the words straight out of my mouth.
Even if SUN were to release Java under GPL, 
these guys still won't shut up.
Now that Java is as open as anything on the planet
I believe it is time to say:
Don't ask what Java can do for you
ask what you can do for your Java.

 Why on earth would they not allow the GPL license.
It is the only license which encourages innovation
and total openness.

 Even then they would complain they would not be paid enough )
They are for OpenSource but they want copyrights ?
(By the way I like the new JavaLobby layout)

 Serge,
 We tried hard to pick a new layout with makes it easy for people to move between forums and between messages and topics. Hopefully we'll be continually improving it to make it even easier.
Matt

 Daniel,
Do ever have anything good to say about Sun?
You act like they need to be torn down. I get the impression that you dont appreciate anything they have done for the Java community. You focus on one or two things that arent right and try to make that define Sun.
Please say something positive occassionally. You have become a negative influence. Is that what you want?
Mark.

 Sun is a commercial venture--they don't hand out freebies. Sun's strategy and policies on Java are entirely driven by the goal of beating Microsoft and trying desparately to keep their platforms viable, just like Microsoft's strategy on C#/.NET is entirely driven by a desire for market domination and control at any cost. The reason why Sun caved in on this minor issue is because if they had lost Apache's support, it would have been devastating for them. And it required an enormous uproar to get Sun to budge even on this issue.
The big, hard issues--lack of availability of independdent implementations, open sourcing Java, contamination clauses, lack of progress on long-promised Java features, and Java2 API bloat--still are as unresolved today as they were a few weeks ago.

 I don't see how any of this is an excuse for bad manners or bad faith.
The question remains: Are open-source advocates serious people, or are they professional complainers who'll never be satisfied?
It's not about Sun at all. If open-source advocates and Sun-critics won't act like serious people, why should anyone continue to take them seriously?

 I don't see how any of this is an excuse for bad manners or bad faith.
If your friend invites you for dinner and you don't say "thank you", that's bad manners. If a multi-billion dollar company gives you a piece of software for "free" in the hope of getting you to commit to it and generating future revenue for the company, you don't say "thank you", you say "what's the catch?".
As for "bad faith", Sun now has a seven year track record on Java, marketing promises, and commitments to Java. And they have failed to live up to their promises. They dropped out of Java standardization processes. They failed to implement important features they promised. And the third party and open implementations they promised have failed to materialize. Sun keeps making promises and breaking them. If people do that to you, do you keep believing what they are telling you?
The question remains: Are open-source advocates serious people, or are they professional complainers who'll never be satisfied?
It's not about Sun at all. If open-source advocates and Sun-critics won't act like serious people, why should anyone continue to take them seriously?
This isn't about open source advocacy. If there were half a dozen independent, commercial implementations of Java2 including its libraries, I'd be happy. The complete absence of Java2 implementations that do not depend on Sun's source code demonstrates that there is something about the Java specifications, implementations, and/or Sun's policies that just keep an open, competitive marketplace from happening. Open source just comes into the picture because it's pretty much the only way in which I think Sun can still rescue their platform.
As for why Sun should keep listenting, the answer is simple: do they want to keep Java users? I'm pretty much fed up with Sun's policies and failure to deliver, and I'm much less likely to develop new software components in Sun Java. I'll certainly not push for company-wide adoption or adoption on external projects anymore. And when people say things like "Java is slow", I stop defending it--what's the point?
The reason to complain about it still is because Sun may perhaps throw around the rudder at the last moment and deliver on their promises. People who complain are still somewhat engaged. But time is running out for Sun.
