Sending e-mail from JSP
To be able to send e-mail, you need access to an "SMTP server". SMTP stands
for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". Most of the email on the internet
is sent using SMTP servers.
If your email address is "you@yourhost.com", then there is
a good chance your SMTP server is either "yourhost.com" or something
like "mail.yourhost.com" or "smtp.yourhost.com". You
need to find out exactly what it is. Your email program should have a "Settings"
page which shows you the name of your SMTP server (perhaps shown as "mail
server" or "outgoing mail server".)
(If you have web-based email, you probably won't be able to send email
out directly.)
Once you have the SMTP server information, you are ready to send email
out from your JSP pages. Following is a small sample that uses the Blazix
Tag library to send an email with an attachment.
First of all, let us write an HTML page to start things off.
Please enter name: 
Please enter email address: 
Now let us write the target JSP, SendMail.jsp. Replace "yoursmtphost.com"
by your SMTP server, and "you@youremail.com" by your email address. 
Before testing it, also create a file "C:\contents.txt" which will be sent
as an attachment.
Please enter an email address.

" instead of "text/plain".
2) Send the HTML file as an attachment, without using any other text. 
In the "blx:email" tag, also set "noText=true".
