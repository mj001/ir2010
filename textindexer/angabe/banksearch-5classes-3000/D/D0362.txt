Over the weekend I got php going and mySQL and have set up an online forum and databases which I'll be using for my classicalmp3.shtml referral page. 
That page is currently getting 250+ visits a day and I plan on making it the focus of any online promotions I/we do.
The forum was setup this afternoon, as an experiment and possibly as a place to discuss business. 
Sometime this week, I plan on upgrading the Classical MP3 page with a membership system that will let users create and manage their links. I plan on making this page a "portal" for a bunch of online musical promotional things including CD promotion and Amazon.com affiliate sales. CD promotion through CD Baby and Amazon. 
I joined the Amazon afilliate program after being part of the MP3.com affiliates for a few months and making several hundred bucks. 
Anyway, any ideas or suggestions I can get from my friends, are welcome. 
http://www.parnasse.com/classicalmp3.shtml - currently the top link when "classical mp3" is a Google search term.
http://www.parnasse.com/phpBB - a Parnasse.com portal BBS front page for any discussion groups we might need.

One sugestion for the ClassicalMp3 listing:
the list could need some kind of sorting - alphabetically, or by genre, or by activity (composer, performer...)

A thought.
 Anyone can register and tune into this, I think, so maybe references to The Group, its current incarnation, and any individual names from the old place should disappear?
 More later,

Right, Reinhold, I'll be making it sorted and also grouped according to instrument/composer. 
I also plan on letting artists add what composers they feature in their repertoire so that can be searched and also let them add a short description.

Shouldn't it be up to the person posting whether or not they wish for anything to appear or disappear. If I want to say fuck off CMM, does it matter? I am here for now (as an example) and it shouldn't matter what my opinion is unless it comes of as boring conversation that gets repeated over and over like spamming. 
Andrys: Maybe it would be better stated that we should forget about the politics of CMM if we choose to post here. I would be totally for not having topics relating to CMM as it has made me nauseous. This is my last one pertaining to it.

Anyways... I hate to say this, but I'm going to need filters and critics to get the best stuff to the top.
A mere alphabetical listing of every pianist or every composer is useless these days. Too many. I can add a few points to go to the top to business associates, but other than that, I intend it to be a quality ranking.

Everyone has been leery of the "critical" approach to these things, but Jeff's right. Like it or not, great music comes from an enormous amount of hard work and learned craft. The best of that also introduces something that can't very well be learned at all: a certain kind of judgement that constantly surprises and justifies those surprises in the same moment.
That doesn't mean I'd expect everyone to have a degree and spout endless technical details; there's many more than one way to "learn". I'm not advocating shutting anyone off the "A" list simply because of their training. In the end , for any composer or performer, what matters is not the intention but rather the result. When I make selections from MP3.com for my radio show, that's exactly how I work; the piece has to grab my ear/mind/emotions, in its ideas, in its proportions, in its quality of exploration, in its execution, and in its recorded presentation.
The case where all of these will be equally strong is impossibly rare; but when some (or if we're lucky, most) of these show a certain level of skill with me as a thinking/feeling listener, I recognise something that has gone beyond the mere "amateur". Whether that guy's had even one day of schooling or even one "official" concert is not important to me; its the result I'm hearing in the actual music in the actual moment.
Sometimes, I hear something that tells me that those sparks are there, only not fully realized yet (if ever). I'm sympathetic and I listen happily, but could I honestly put that guy in the same group as say, Horowitz or Stravinsky?
The most common complaint will always be "But who can really judge? It's all just a matter of one person's taste against the other". Yes, of course. And no, of course. Let's say that we're going to do the Winter Olympics a little differently this year; we'll simply open it up to anyone who wants to come skate. We'll applaud everyone politely, say "wasn't that fun!", and go home agin. Michelle Kwan was skating, right there in between Ed Asner and your neighbor's kid. Was she any better? Did anybody even watch? 
Every skill and art has standards that we use to define it. In the skating example, the neighbor's kid can protest that she's got every right to be there; or she can recognise where she really is, and if she's happy with what she is; or that she needs more work, effort, blood & tears, and a dash of something unlearnable before she can be considered to be "there".

I'm going to need critics and writers, both for the new music portal and for the classical mp3 portal. By being agnostic about OMD, we should get a lot of traffic if we promote only the toppest of the top notch. 
My model is http://www.slashdot.org but music-y.

The lack of filtering, ultimately, is the problem with collectives. Completely un-ordered listings of artists are useless. Collectives that merely lists artists regardless of talent or achievement are as ineffective at creating compelling music distribution systems as OMD's. 
We have a chance here to create a unique and provocative music distribution environment that will invite deeper visitations to our musical web sites. 
My first inclination is to be primitive and just list my favorite artists, both performers and composers. We can later create a method of having select experts in different performance practices that will be allowed to vote and modify the ordering. 
At the same time, we need to take a few risks and featire some more eccentric artists - even just weird amateurs or guys getting started. We need to encourage growth and inspire achievement. 
I know this sounds kind of fascist at the moment, but its a time to take risks and if anybody else wants to create a web portal they can do so themselves...

Well, why not just list your favorites to start, but why not look at other existing resources as well--Steve's station, for example, or newmusicbox (unless they're the competition )?

Hey, David, you're one of the biggest ol' new-music hound dogs around when it comes to sniffing out unknown stuff!...
What I'd recommend (if Jeff can stand the deluge, and ONLY when he says "yes"...) is that perhaps each of us (and anyone Jeff might care to invite) send him, by EMAIL, a list of, say, our top twenty or thirty interesting yet possibly overlooked performers and composers that have a web presence. By that I mean that they have enough info, sound, or etc. to make someone's visit enlightening. The artists could come from anyplace on the web, but preferably from pages directly created by or for them. That would get some diverse input in there, but still let Jeff make the quick gut call on if and where they show up.

Dag, Steve, you read my mind again! That's going to be my approach. Invite a bunch of experts, get resources and then depend on them to help me get the good stuff to the top. 
I was hoping to make a web interface for this, well eventually, with admin privs and you can add resources and add a numeric indicator (1-10?) which will help the resources go to the top. 
At the same time I was thinking to let the audience, themselves, write reviews of select artists. These would have to be reviewed themselves, but would eventually form (like at Amazon) a type of recommendation. 
If you guys want to start emailing me, I'll start collecting the resources. (David and Steve). Invites to other experts will go out as I get around to it or as they come forward.

About newmusicbox... 
I'd like to feature them on the portal, too, but because they're a NGO, and rely on membership $$, they have to feature crap. 
Plus their site sucks, it's slow and down a lot. Their forums are horrible! They have no $$ for improvements and they have this wretched project to put music online using Microsoft Audio formats (to please the ASCAP's and BMI's).

At Kalvos & Damian, we'll be happy to help out, though like all of you, we're pretty stretched right now.
Our own new project is NonPop International Network, a psychological network of broadcasts/cybercasts focusing on new stuff. It's at http://nonpopradio.com/ (nothing much there yet, as I've just started sending out invitations).
K&D is limping along in the portal business, that's for sure. Our off-site composer links are so far behind, fully half our dead now. I hate that feeling of being sucked into the great wormhole of unfinished projects, coming back out where I started...
In any case, this is a very good idea, and I'd like to see how it fits in with the NonPop International Network in getting visibility in major media for the meta-genre. Ya nevah know.
Dennis
