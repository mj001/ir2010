I want to put out up to 4 CD's this year. I've got old and new electronic music coming out and I have to make a decision. Should I pop for a full 500 CD's from OasisCD and get the really cool covers and the non-digital graphics? 
Or should I be more judicious and just do Ampcast; send 5 CD's I buy for $8.00 (barcodes) to CD-Baby.
The goal is to create some type of online distribution buzz that can get my CD's off the ground.

This is exactly what got me excited about Ampcast's CD program in the first place. Their cost-per-unit is of course high, since it's almost a one-off process, but that same "one-offness" makes it ideal for inserting small amounts of real CDs in certain places, & not having 500 laying around if nobody's biting. Most online places (like Amazon) only stock 5 or 10 of your CDs anyway. The fact that you can have it made from a real "redbook" standard master CD is great; the graphic package can be quite good; and you get the all-important shrinkwrap and barcode. The downside is that you're likely at best to break even, and quite possibly even lose some money on each sale, unless you really bumped the retail price up. Still, it does seem like a good way to "test the waters" initially, and if something actually seemed to show some demand, you could always run over & get a "real" run of CDs ginned up.
