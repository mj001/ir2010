Site Design and Development 
The site was designed and developed by Lori Baldwin Coppinger (Richard's
daughter). 
Lori holds a BBA from the University of Texas at Austin and has over 14
years of experience serving in management and executive roles at software
companies including Radian International, Novell and Pervasive Software.
In addition, she has experience as a software game producer which has contributed
greatly to her interest in web design and web application development.
Lori now provides marketing and business consulting services to high tech
start-ups located primarily in Austin, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area
and Europe. She can be reached by sending an e-mail
or calling (512)263-1234. 
By the way, just in case you are curious about the image at the bottom of some of the pages that 
reads Sanitized for Your Protection, that was Lori's idea. She still remembers an inexpensive 
coffee shop that we frequently visited when she was a child. At that coffee shop, the eating 
utensils were sealed in clear plastic with a tag that read something like Sanitized for Your Protection.
