 RE: CWI HOSTING 
 
Hello Java/JSP Community
I am in the midst of finding a new ISP because I am currently with CWI Hosting. 
Their service has been abominable. The best part is that when you ask what went wrong there's always an excuse about hackers or hardware problems. Our JVM has been switched off 4 times in 3 months without our knowing it. We have to babysit our website and as an upstart company with an interactive website, this is unacceptable. They have also been rude in their replies to our service queries: now that they have our money (we paid 1 year in advance) they obviously don't care anymore.
DON'T USE THEM.
Please feel free to contact me with any further questions, I would be happy to save someone else the money and hassle of doing business with those amateurs.
I DEEPLY regret having gone with CWI Hosting.
Good luck

(...hopefully the site is up until I can find a better ISP :-)
