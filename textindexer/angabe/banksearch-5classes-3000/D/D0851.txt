Buttons 
 
 We are going to start with what is probably
the most important Graphical User Interface component, the button. There are a
few constructors for buttons, all listed below:
Button objectnamegoeshere=new Button("text for button goes here");
Button objectnamegoeshere=new Button();
 The first constructor is probably more
common, because it automatically puts text on the button. (The text that goes
on the button goes inside the parentheses. Remember that unless it is a
variable, it has to be in quotes!) 
 If you choose to use the second
constructor, and want some text to appear on the button, you need to use
the setLabel() method after the constructor. For example:
Button test=new Button();
test.setLabel("Hello");
 This would make a button, and then put the
text Hello on it. The setLabel method can be used as many times as you would
like however, at any point in the code.
 An example of buttons in java is listed in
the following applet:
 Here is the code for the applet above:
//-----------------------------/
//Copyright 2000 FreeJavaHelp.com/
//-------------------------------/
//This applet will teach you how to use buttons
//and their methods
//the next line imports the class so this program can be an applet
import java.applet.Applet;
//this imports the AWT components so you can make your
//Graphical User Interface
import java.awt.*;
//this makes a program called usingbuttons which is an applet
public class usingbuttons extends Applet{
 //makes a simple run of the mill button
 Button norm=new Button("Run of the Mill");
 //makes a normal button, but uses the setLabel()
 //method to set the text, who's name is lab
 Button lab=new Button();
 //makes a button who's name is color
 Button colo=new Button("This Button is Red");
 //public void init() occurs when the applet is initialized
	public void init(){
 add(norm);
 add(lab);
 add(colo);
 //this is the method that actually sets the
 //label of the lab button
 lab.setLabel("setLabel() Method");
 //this method set the background color of the
 //button named color
 colo.setBackground(Color.red);
 //The Color class contains some default colors
 // one of which is red
 }
}
 Remember that on any given line, if you see
//, then the rest of the line is comments. For example, the line
 //The Color class contains some default colors, one of which is red
 is simply there to tell you what is happening in the next few lines
of code. This example simply explains the the Color.red in the code above is
simply the color red!
