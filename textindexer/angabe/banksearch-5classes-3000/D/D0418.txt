Getting Familiar with your JSP server
If you do not have a JSP capable web-server (sometimes known as application
servers for configuration reasons), the first step is to download one. 
There are many such servers available, most of which can be downloaded
for free evaluation and/or development. Some of them are:
Blazix
from Desiderata Software (1.5 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs)
ServletExec
from New Atlanta/Unify (3.8 Megabytes, JSP and Servlets)
JRun from Allaire
(11 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs)
WebLogic from BEA
Systems (44 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs)
WebSphere
from IBM (105 Megabytes, JSP, Servlets and EJBs)
If you do not already have a server, it is recommended that you download
Blazix
because it includes a tag library that is used later in this tutorial in
the tag library chapter. Blazix is also very small and can be easily
downloaded even over a modem, will work on all kinds of systems including
Windows 98, and can be installed in less than ten minutes.
To truly learn JSP, it is really very important that you try out the
examples with a real server. This web-site doesn't have running
examples because running examples really don't do a good teaching job. 
The best way to learn the technology is to get hands-on experience. 
If you don't have a server, please go get one and install it now!
Once you have a web-server, you need to know the following information
about your web-server:
- 
Where to place the files
- 
How to access the files from your browser (with an http: prefix,
not as file:)
You should be able to create a simple file, such as
Hello, world
know where to place this file and how to see it in your browser with an
http://
prefix.
Since this step is different for each web-server, you would need to
see the web-server documentation to find out how this is done. Once
you have completed this step, proceed to the next tutorial.
