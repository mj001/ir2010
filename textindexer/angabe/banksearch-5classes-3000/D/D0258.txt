Build and Test
 
	
	Before we can continue, we must define the mappings in our lesavon web application for Tomcat. 
 
 
 Le Savon Application 
 
 This is the Le Savon Application. 
 
	
	
	We map com.lesavon.service.Serveur to the name "Le Serveur". We now route all calls to /serveur to this servlet. This will mean that any client that attempts to connect to 
	http://localhost:8080/lesavon/serveur will have its request forwarded to the Serveur 
	(cached) router. 
	
 
 Le Serveur 
 com.lesavon.service.Serveur 
 
 
 Le Serveur 
 /serveur 
 
 
 Le Serveur 
 / serveur/ 
 
	
 
 
	
 
 
	The RPCRouterServlet is named "Non-Cached Router" and it is mapped to any calls for /ncrouter 
	in the lesavon web application. 
	
	
 
 Non-Cached Router 
 Apache-SOAP RPC Router 
 A router with no cache. 
 
 org.apache.soap.server.http. RPCRouterServlet 
 
 
 faultListener 
 org.apache.soap.server.DOMFaultListener 
 
 
 
 Non-Cached Router 
 / ncrouter 
 
 
 Non-Cached Router 
 /ncrouter/ 
 
 
 
 
	The web.xml file should be stored in a folder named C:\ProJavaSoap\Chapter5\etc together with 
	the soap.xml file created earlier. We must now add a couple of lines to the ANT script to make sure 
	that the new files are copied to the correct destinations. 
	
	
	The web.xml file must be placed inside the WEB-INF directory of the lesavon web application, 
	ofcourse. We add the following lines to the BuildLeSavon. xml file: 
	
 
 
 
	 
	Next, we must copy the RemoteAdmin.xml and RemoteOrder.xml descriptors to the C:\ ProJavaSoap\ Chapter05\ webapps\ lesavon\ WEB-INF\ classes\ com\ lesavon 
	directory. Our configuration manager will look for these files here. We must also copy the soap.xml file to the 
	
	
	lesavon web application directory: 
 
 
 
 
	The resultant ANT file is called BuildLeSavon_2.xml in the code download. 
	The sample code for this chapter can be found in the ProJavaSoap\Chapter05\leSavon directory 
	in the code download. The following screenshot shows a build on a Windows 2000 machine: 
 
	
	
	You will have to adjust the classpath to your particular settings, but the list of JAR files should be the 
	same. The servlet.jar file must be included in the classpath now since we are compiling servlets. As 
	shown in the previous figure, ANT does most of the work for us. 
	
	
	We will also need to add the following context to Tomcat's server.xml as we did in Chapter 3. 
	
 
 
 
 
	Alternatively, the entire contents of Chapter 5's webapps directory may be moved to Tomcat's 
	directory; this will have the same effect. We can test that the application is installed as we did in 
	Chapter 3, by navigating to http:// localhost: 8080/ lesavon/ ncrouter. This should give the message: 
	"Sorry, I don't speak via HTTP GET-you have to use HTTP POST to talk to me" as before. 
	Remember that the ncrouter is being provided by the soap servlet that does not accept GET requests. 
	
	
	To test the GetOrders client, you first need to make sure that Tomcat is running. The instructions to set up Tomcat are described in Chapter 3. As usual, pay particular attention to classpath issues. You 
	must make sure that Tomcat can load the new classes by making sure that the system classpath for 
	Tomcat includes the webapps/lesavon/WEB-INF/classes as shown in the following screenshot:
