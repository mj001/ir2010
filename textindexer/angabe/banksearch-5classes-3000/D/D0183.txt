	embedding Japhar in Mozilla
	 
 
 
	
	 This is a step-by-step guide to making the Japhar/OJI plugin
	 for Mozilla. (Note: The
	 Japhar/OJI plugin is only available at present for Unix.)
	 
	 
	 
- Get the Mozilla source:
 
	 Information on retrieving the mozilla source can be found
	 here.
	 
	 
- Build mozilla as normal:
	 Build instructions for mozilla can be found
	 here.
	 
	 
- Configure Japhar to use Mozilla/NSPR:
	 Configure Japhar with the following command (there is no carriage return on this line):
	 
	 configure --with-mozilla= --enable-nspr --enable-oji --with-sun-jdk=
	 
	 
- Build japhar normally:
	 
	 
- Build the Japhar/OJI plugin:
	
	 cd 
	 gmake japhar_oji
	
	 
	 
- Install the Japhar/OJI plugin:
	 
	cp /lib/liboji/.libs/libjaphar_oji.so.0.0 ~/.netscape/plugins
	 
	 
	 
- Rerun Mozilla:
	 That's it! Go to a web page with APPLET tags on it.
	 
	 
	 
	 Note: You will most
	 definitely find applets that don't work. Don't expect
	 much. OJI is evolving, and Japhar is as well. Please,
	 let us know of any
	 problems you have.
