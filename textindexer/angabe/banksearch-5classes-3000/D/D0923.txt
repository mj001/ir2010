Welcome to the new Javalobby discussion forums homepage. We've 
 just completed our switch to Jive 
 Software's Java based discussion forum software. We hope you'll like all 
 of the new features that the Jive software enables us to add to our forums. 
 Please let us know if you have any ideas or suggestions for improving the operation 
 of our discussion forums, or for any of the features and site content on Javalobby 
 by posting a new topic in our Javalobby Enhancements 
 forum.
 
Guest visitors to our forums can search for, and read any
 of the messages in our forums. Only Javalobby members can create new topics
 and reply to messages.
