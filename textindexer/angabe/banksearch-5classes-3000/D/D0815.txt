Let's call it a soft launch! Finally picked a skin, wrote some prefacing text and added a few links that Steve emailed me and that I was planning.
Couldn't figure out how to feature the links, but I'm pretty happy with the general layout.

David, if you get a recording, I can host it as a "Featured Download" at the site... 
Thanks and good luck on the performance.
Jeff
