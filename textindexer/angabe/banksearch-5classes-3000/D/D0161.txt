Compile and run
To build class files from your source code you use a compiler.
You can download Sun's System Development Kit, SDK.
Windows example :
In an MSDOS console window go to the directory that contains Simplest.java.
For example :
 
d: 
to drive D: 
cd \ 
to root directory 
cd work 
to directory work 
Type d:\jdk1.3\bin\javac.exe Simplest.java
( The d:\jdk1.3 part depends on where you've installed
your download.)
This will either result in the Simplest.class file or in error
messages, if you've mishpeledd something, omitted a ; 
, have a } too many, mixed up lowercase,uppercase, etc....
Alternatively, you could use a tool like Borland's JBuilder.
The Simplest.class file contains Java instructions, bytecodes.
Put this file in the same directory/folder as the HTML file, Simplest.html .
Open the HTML file in your browser and see the applet run.
Another way to test an applet, is by using Sun's appletviewer tool:
 d:\jdk1.3\bin\appletviewer.exe Simplest.html
Yes, the argument is the HTML file.
This, unlike a browser, ignores the rest of the HTML, though. Only
convenient for testing the applet by itself.
If you're very satisfied with your applet and want to publish
it, FTP the class file(s) binary(!) to the same directory as where you copy your HTML
file to. So, if the HTTPserver is Apache, this would probably be the htdocs
directory or one of its subdirectories.
 
HAVE FUN !
Running a stand-alone application, without a browser, is different. We
will deal with that in our Applet or Application ? lesson .
(You can make typing life easier by setting a path to the bin directory and omitting .exe or even by making a script )
