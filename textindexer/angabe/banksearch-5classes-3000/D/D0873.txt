11) The java.io package 
Objective 2 )
Write code that uses objects of the 
 classes InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter to translate between Unicode 
 and either platform default or ISO 8859-1 character encodings. 
I was surprised that this objective was not
be emphasized in the JDK1.2 exams 
 as internationalization has been enhanced
and is a big feature with Java. It's 
 nice to sell software to a billion Europeans
and Americans but a billion Chinese 
 would be a nice additional market (even
if you only got 10% of it). This is 
 the kind of objective that even experienced
Java programmers may not have experience
 with, so take note!.
Java Character Encoding: UTF and Unicode
Java uses two closely related encoding systems
UTF and unicode. Java was designed from the
ground up to deal with multibyte character
sets and can deal with the vast numbers of
characters that can be stored using the unicode
character set. Unicode characters are stored
in two bytes which allows for up to 65K worth
of characters. This means it can deal with
Japanese Chinese, and just about any other
character set known. You will be pleased
to know that you don't have to give examples
of any of these for the exam.
Although unicode can represent almost any
character you would ever likely to use it
is not an efficient coding method for programming.
Most of the text data within a program uses
standard ASCII, most of which can easily
be stored within one byte. For reasons of
compactness Java uses a system called UTF-8
for string literals, identifiers and other
text within programs. This can result in
a considerable saving by comparison with
using unicode where every character requires
2 bytes.
The StreamReader Class
The StreamReader class converts a byte input
(i.e. not relating to any character set)
into a character input stream, one that has
a concept of a character set. If you are
only concerned with ASCII style character
sets you will probably only use these Reader
classes in the form with the constructor
InputStreamReader(InputStream in)
This version uses the platform-dependent default encoding. In JDK 1.1 this 
 default is identified by the file.encoding system property. There seems to be 
 no standard way of finding out what encodings are supported on your platform 
 The default encoding is generally ISO Latin-1 except on a Mac where it is MacRoman.. 
 If this system property is not defined, the default encoding identifier is 8859_1 
 (ISO-LATIN-1). The assumption seems to be that if all else fails, revert back 
 to English. Experimenting with other character sets is problematic as the characters 
 may not show up correctly if you environment is not configured appropriately. 
 Thus if you attempt to output a character from the Chinese character set you 
 system may not support it.
 
 If you are dealing with other character sets you can use
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding);
 
 
 
 
 
The StreamReader and Writer classes can take
 either a character encoding parameter or
 be left to use the platform default encoding
 
 
 
 Remember that the InputStream comes first and encoding second. 
The read and and write methods
The InputStreamReader class has a read() method and the OutputStreamWriter 
 has a write() method that read and write characters. When the read method is 
 called it reads bytes from the input stream and converts them to Unicode characters 
 using the encoding specified in the stream constructor. When the write() method 
 is called the the characters from the stream are converted to their corresponding 
 byte encoding and stored in an internal buffer. When the buffer becomes full 
 the contents are written to the underlying byte output stream.
GreekWriter Example
 The sample code for GreekWriter writes a text output file containing some 
 letters in the Greek alphabet. If you open this file Out.txt with an editor 
 you will just see what looks like junk.
import java.io.*;
class GreekWriter {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
	String str = "\u03B1\u03C1\u03B5\u03C4\u03B7";
 try {
 Writer out = 
 new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream("out.txt"), "8859_7");
	//8859_7 is the ISO code for ASCII plus greek, although this
	//example also works on my machine if it is set to UTF8
 out.write(str);
 out.close();
 } catch (IOException e) {
 e.printStackTrace();
 }
 }
}
GreekReader Example

import java.awt.*;
class GreekReader extends Frame{

 int ch;
 while ((ch = in.read()) > -1) {
 buf.append((char)ch);
 }
 in.close();
	 str = buf.toString();
	 
 } catch (IOException e) {
 e.printStackTrace();
 }

 public void paint(Graphics g) {
	//paint method automatically called by the system
 Insets insets = getInsets();
 int x = insets.left, y = insets.top;
	//Add 30 to y or we will only see the
	//downstrokes of the letters 
 g.drawString(str, x, y +30);
 }
public void setWin(){
 //Nice big font so we can see the characters.
 Font font = new Font("Monospaced", Font.BOLD, 59);
 setFont(font);
 setSize(200,200);
 setVisible(true);
 //Show the frame
 show();
 }
}

Questions
Question 1)
Which of the following statements are true?
1) The OutputStreamWriter must take a character encoding as a constructor parameter
 2) The default encoding for the OutputStreamWriter is ASCII
 3) The InputStreamWriter and OutputStreamWriter may take a character encoding 
 as a constructor
 4) InputStreamReader must take a stream as one of its constructors
Question 2)
Which of the following statements are true?
1) Java can display character sets independently of the underlying operating 
 system
2) The InputStreamReader class may take an
instance of another InputStream class as
a constructor
 3) An InputStreamReader may act as a constructor to an OutputStreamReader to 
 convert between character sets
4) Java uses the ASCII encoding system to
store strings internally
Question 3)
 Which of the following are correct signatures for InputStreamReader?
1) InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding);
 2) InputStreamReader(String encoding,InputStream in);
 3) InputStreamReader(String encoding,File f); 
 4) InputStreamReader(InputStream in); 
Question 4)

 2) write()
 3) getBuffer()
 4) getString()
Question 5)
Which of the following statements are true?
1) Java uses unicode to internally to store string literals

 4) Java uses the platform native encoding to store string literals
 
Answers
Answer to Question 1)
 3) The InputStreamWriter and OutputStreamWriter may take a character encoding 
 as a constructor
 4) InputStreamReader must take a stream as one of its constructors
Answer to Question 2)
1) Java can display character sets independently of the underlying operating 
 system
2) The InputStreamReader class takes may
take an instance of another InputStream class
as a constructor
Although Java can store characters independently
of the underlying operating system, the appropriate
font must be installed on the underlying
operating system in order to display those
characters. Generally streams are chained
with like streams, ie InputStreams take constructors
of other InputStreams and OutputStreams take
constructors of OutputStreams. Java uses
the UTF encoding system to store strings
internally.
Answer to Question 3)
1) InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding); 
 4) InputStreamReader(InputStream in); 
If you do not specify an encoding the JVM will assume the platform default 
 encoding 
Answer to Question 4)
1) read()
Answer to Question 5)
3) Java uses UTF-8 to internally store string literals
