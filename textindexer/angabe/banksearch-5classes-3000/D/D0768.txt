keyDown()

 THIS WEEKS ARTICLE: keyDown()
------------------------------------------------------------
	You have to love the mouseDown(), mouseMove(), and 
other methods like it that let you handle events without 
importing classes or doing anything too painful. This week
I'm going to show you another one of these methods. It is
keyDown() . I came across it when a user submitted a game to
the site, and was instantly hooked. It provides a very simple
way to use even the arrow keys (which I had no clue how to do
before in an applet). Anyways, here is the basic format.
public boolean keyDown(Event evt, int key) {
 //Code goes here
 return true;
}
	Those are the basics. You put the code to handle your
event after the beginning of the method but before the "return
true;" line. An applet was made to go along with this article,
and it will be posted in the tutorials section soon. For now,
I will explain the code. Here is the code for the applet:
import java.awt.*;
import java.applet.*;
public class keydownt extends Applet {
	int x=20,y=20;
	public void init() {
 
	}
	public boolean keyDown(Event evt, int key) {
 	if(key==Event.LEFT){x-=5;}
 	if(key==Event.RIGHT){x+=5;}
 	if(key==Event.UP){y-=5;}
 	if(key==Event.DOWN){y+=5;}
 	repaint();
 	return true;
	}
	public void paint(Graphics g){
 	g.setColor(Color.red);
 	g.fillRect(x,y,10,10);
	}
}
	I hope that comes out readable through the email! 
Anyways, what this applet basically does is draw a red
square, and the square moves when you press the arrow keys.
The if statements in the keyDown() method are used to decide
which key was pressed. The "key" variable is an integer which
represents a numeric code for a certain key. The Event class
stores the integer for the arrow keys in the LEFT, RIGHT, UP
and DOWN variables of the Event class.
