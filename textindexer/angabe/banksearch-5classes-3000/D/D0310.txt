	Variables	
What are member variables?
Member variables are defined within the class but not within a method of the class. Member variables are available for use by all methods of the class.
static int num_recs=50; defines a constant integer variable with the value of 50.
List itemList = new List(5,false); creates a List object to display 5 items. The "false" parameter indicates that multiple items can not be selected from the List.
String email_address [ ] = new String[50]; defines an array of String objects with a maximum of 50 items.
Each object is an instance of a class previously defined with its own data and methods. The List object is available to the Contact class as part of the java.awt.* package. Here is the reference documentation that specifies the 
List object. Here is the reference documentation index for all Java objects.
