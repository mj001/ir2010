Finally decided to install PostNuke (and maybe I'll switch to the phpBB2 portal - if and when it gets going).
This php stuff rocks!

I just uploaded several hundred "themes" so if the look and feel really sucks when you look at it try again in 2 minutes...

The "grayscale" look is pretty severe; not awful, just severe. The logo text and perhaps the box labels could show just a little color, and it would make a world of difference. Eventually I'd assume that there'd be some kind of pic or two in the main space most of the time (even if it's a couple composer's ugly mugs), and all that would be more than enough to make it perk up. 
What's with the spacing of the letters in the logo text? It's wildly variable. And the "gee wiz" of the logo and box labels zooming around when the page loads is one of those things that I get tired of REALLY quickly; doesn't add a thing to the experience, except time (the deadly web enemy). And the logo deciding to do its little dance any time I get the mouse too close (actually covering up parts of the user bar) is pretty annoying. 
I also think that page counters should be dead; if you're new and unknown, the number hurts rather than helps; and if you're getting lots of visits and a good rep, then the number could matter less.
Things like "Big Story" should go above things like "Poll".
All that said, The design itself is really clean and sharp, with a lot of options for different info and tools. I like that term "AvantGo"...

OK, the iMac look is a change from the gray. Cute, but a little "bubbly"? Well, this could be fun. I'll have to stop by and see how often you change the theme.

OK, I'm thinking of a variant (maybe a grid pattern background?) of this. 
You guys hate it? Too boring? I could add some color, too...

[sigh] It wouldn't let me post anything telling me I had to identify myself etc.
I did, and then it wiped out my wee message after your quote. Here's another try.

 I enjoyed the text in the middle! 
 The purple gray on the left is a bit flat next to light grey on the right.
 But this is better than the garish screens I see all over.
 Good start!
