Which do you feel is more important, innovation or standards compliance?
- Innovation is most important, technology should be pushed as far and as 
fast as it can.
- Neither is important to me.
- Standards and innovation are equally important
- Standards compliance is essential, innovation should take second place.
- Standards compliance is important only if it doesn't slow down innovation 
or break old code.
