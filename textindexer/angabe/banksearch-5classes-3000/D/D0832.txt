	 My virtual organizer 1.0
	 A program which fulfills the role of a real organizer. It has a
built-in clock, calendar, address book and appointment list.
'MVO' is able to remind you of your appointments on the day
itself. There is even a search engine for the searching of any
entries needed. There is a password system to preserve the
user's privacy. There is even an area which you can mount your
favorite image! It comes with a help file for the layman.
Requires the 'Java Runtime Environment', which is not packaged
with this file.
