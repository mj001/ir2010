SOAP Fault
 
	
	The following diagram shows that the SOAP element appears as a entry. 
	
	
	
	 
	The SOAP Fault is optional, but there can only be one element per element. The 
	SOAP element contains up to four elements: 
	
- 
	The element allows the client to algorithmically identify the source of the fault. 
	As you can see from the following table, this mechanism is similar to what we saw for HTTP when it comes to differentiating the source of the error. However, rather than using numerical 
	values, SOAP uses XML qualified names. The version mismatch and mustUnderstand fault 
	codes are particular to SOAP. 
	Name Meaning 
	Version Mismatch The namespace for the SOAP envelope is not 
	"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/". 
	
	mustUnderstand One of the header entries was not understood by the 
	receiving party and the mustUnderstand flag was set to 
	"1" (true). 
 
	Client The message received was incorrectly formed. A 
	typical example of this would be a lack of serialization 
	information. 
 
	Server The receiving web service could not process the message. 
	This situation would arise if the application were to throw 
	an exception. The detail section of the fault might contain 
	the stack of exception. 
 
	
	
- 
	Once again, the strong affinity of SOAP to HTTP shows up in the element, 
	since it is similar to the reason phrase that we saw earlier. Note that the 
	must be present. The is mostly intended for human readers as opposed to 
	the , which is intended for algorithmic use. 
	
- 
	The element names the service that generated the fault. The NullPointerException 
	in the example below was thrown inside the ncrouter of the lesavon context. The is more meaningful in a situation where there is more 
	than one recipient for the SOAP message. We will look at an example of this when we talk 
	about the SOAPActor in the Messaging section. 
	 
	
	
- 
	The element is meant to carry application-specific information. It must be present 
	if the application could not process the element. In other words, its presence or 
	absence can be used to test if the error was related to processing the body. For instance, the 
	fault example with an unknown service does not contain a element, as the request never made it to the service (in this case because the service was not registered). 
	
	Note that the Apache SOAP implementation will not generate a element if you do not 
	include a fault listener in your deployment descriptor. We will look more closely at deployment 
	descriptors in the next chapter, when we write the HelloWorld sample. Instead of the fault shown in 
	the previous example, you would get the following: 
 
 SOAP-ENV:Server 
 Exception from service object: null 
 /realtimequotes/ncrouter 
 
	
	In addition to these four elements, a SOAP fault may contain additional namespace-qualified elements. 
	Next, we will discuss the rules that SOAP defines to encode its payloads.
