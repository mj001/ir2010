I recently downloaded all my MP3.COM MP3's (about 60) and put up 10 or so to a new web site, http://www.classicalarts.net after a Linux user (and the coordinator of the Icking Score Archive) wrote me and told me he wouldn't listen to music online that required him to give out personal info. 
Whatever... 8(
Now it's linked to a very popular MP3 directory (I'll have to link it up) and I'm getting on some days 10-20 more downloads than my regulare 30-100 from MP3.COM. 
Argh.

here you go... with the future of online music...
there is just nobody out there who wants to pay, and some not even with their email - the latter one is very much understandable: after my wife went to MP3.COM and gave her email address, she got all kinds of spam afterwards, not only MP3 related!
Well, at least from your personal site, you get exposure. No bucks though...

 The one thing about the otherwise low-traffic Ampcast, which is slowly building, is that you do find out if someone likes what they hear enough to download given what listeners have to go through to do that.
 I also like that people can't buy chart position. It makes it that one iota more meaningful compared to a place where people with lots of cash to buy $200 to $2000 spots get all the slots. The company's daily featuring of some, regardless of quality, on the overall, topmost, umbrella page, means mp3.com decides who gets the bonuses. 
 As implied, genre-busting like "Strangers in the Night" or "Misty" in "Classical" just 
steals from classical-music types who already find it hard to get heard at all.
 What Ampcast needs to do is not count '1'ratings given by artists to other artists or give them much less weight. 
 
 Money? Reinhold said it all. I think mp3.com's marketing ploy to get artists involved made it hard for people to be anything but dissatisfied with what remains, after they/Universal decided to end it. 
Steve is right that professionals, at least, need to get visitors directly to their pages. That means marketing (just as in real life), even if online it means letting people you talk with online about this and that know about your music.

I felt something like this at MP3.com for quite a while now, and in some ways it only makes sense; you can't promote the "major" acts effectively in the same place that is open to anyone. And the only way I can see them dealing with it is either: A) gear all of the mechanism in such a way that everything skews towards the "major" artists, or B) eventually cut loose the indie and amateur artists either onto a separate site (where they can "do no harm") or just cut them loose, period. For the moment, they haven't figured out how to make the majors "pay" online, but they have gotten a bunch of buck-chasing wannabees to shell out for a while. My feeling is they'll milk them for whatever they can, only as long as it takes for the Big Label music to find the model they're going to run with.

Depressing but probably the naked truth. In the meantime, those who can make the PAS and pay nothing to mp3.com (though I think it's fair to pay something for both unlimited storage and reliable streaming to all kinds of machines!) are still ahead of their game.
 What interests me is that people are left from the old mp3.com who WERE interested in the indie aspects and who are trying to show Universal that this group CAN sell CDs (Universal's prime interest and they can't see beyond that) and so the struggling oldtimers weight everything on CD sales while gritting their teeth at the rationalizations they have to spin at us for all the rotten ideas like the truly awful Auction-winner-banner on all our pages.
 In my view they're hoping mp3.com's Indies area will survive but I've not got high hopes.
