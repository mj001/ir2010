	 JBC Gui BEANS SUITE
	 JBC Gui BEANS SUITE is a collection of JavaBeans(tm) compatible with Java(tm) 2 platforms, from Java 1.2 versions, written entirely in the Java(tm) programming language. Based on Swing(tm) components, this collection supports all Java(tm) Look and Feel such as Windows(tm), Motif(tm), Macintosh(tm) etc... These beans allow to increase user friendliness of user interface, as well as productivity of developers by using tested, operational, re-usable beans. They may be included to Java(tm) applications or applets. They may be added as add-on to the VisualMust interface builder by JBCSolutions or to other interface builders available on the market, such as Forte(tm), JBuilder(tm), VisualAge(tm)... 
So far, this collection contains : 
JbcBevelText : creates texts in 3D 
JbcCircularSlider : a three-dimensional rotating slider 
JbcMetallicPushButton : a three-dimensional push button. It may be elliptic 
JbcMetallicToggleButton : a three-dimensional toggle button. It may be elliptic 
JbcProgressBar : a three-dimensional progress bar 
JbcSpinButton : a spin button that handles suite of integers
 
JbcLongSpinButton : a spin button that handles suite of long integers 
JbcStringSpinButton : a spin button that handles strings 
JbcNeedleIndicator : a component that lets the user graphically show a value within a bounded interval 
JbcNeedleGauge : a component that lets the user graphically show a value within a bounded interval 
JbcDateTimeChooser : a date and time chooser 
JbcClock : a graphic clock object

	 EJB Benchmark
	 Over the last few years, we've seen a number of J2EE projects fall prey to performance problems. Our own experiences developing J2EE applications have indicated that the use of session beans instead of entity beans can overcome such performance difficulties. While we've found that other experienced J2EE developers share this view, the practice of using session beans for database access remains undocumented and has not been advanced as a best practice. Hoping that some quantitative figures will help convince developers of the performance improvement that session beans offer, we developed this EJB Performance Benchmark. 
The benchmark data demonstrates that there is between a 3 and 90 fold performance improvement available just by switching from entity beans to stateless session beans. 
The benchmark is an interactive web based application that you can use to gather your own data.
