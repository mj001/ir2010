This applet is a simple text animation which
"grows" a user specified string from a minimum font point size to a maximum
point size, both specified by the user as APPLET tag parameters. If the user clicks on the
applet container, it restarts the animation. 
This is what the mark-up looks like to implement the
growing text applet in your HTML page (Note: this assumes that growing_text_andyhosk.class
is in the same directory as it's parent HTML page). The parameters, by the way, correspond
to the instance that is running on this page right now:

 Parameter 
 Possible Values

 Any string; represents the "growing" text . 
 
 
 fonttype 
 Any installed font. 
 
 
 fontstyle 
 plain, bold, or italic. 
 
 
 minfontsize 
 Any valid point size. This is the point size that the text
 string starts at. This must be less than maxfontsize. 
 
 
 maxfontsize 
 Any valid point size. This is the point size that
 the text string ends at. This must be greater than minfontsize. 
 
 
 bgcolor 
 white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, or an
 integer representing the RGB value (See Note Below). 
 
 
 fgcolor 
 white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, or an
 integer representing the RGB value (See Note Below). 
 
 
 timeinterval 
 Time delay between frames, in milliseconds; for all
 intents and purposes, represents the speed at which the text "grows". 
 
Background and Foreground Color Attributes 
Most people will find the six basic colors sufficient.
However, you can set the background or foreground color of the applet to any one of the
16+ million colors in the 24 bit RGB (Red-Green-Blue) spectrum. But first, you must
calculate the value of your custom color. To facilitate this, please use this
calculator.
