 the best book to get started with, and continue to

 haven't used yet. Highly recommended. It's also available
 in hypertext format online at http://www.javasoft.com:80/nav/read/Tutorial/index.html

 book focusing on the Java AWT. Another one of my
 favorites.

 K&R of Java. This is a must have reference book for
 Java programmers.
