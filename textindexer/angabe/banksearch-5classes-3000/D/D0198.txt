SOAP Server
 
	
	In this chapter, we will concentrate on the server for the sample application. We will start by discussing the architecture of the sample application in a little more detail. Then we will write the four components 
	of the SOAP server: 
	
- 	 A cached router 
	
- 	 A un-cached router 
	
- 	 The RemoteOrder interface and its implementation, the OrderService class 
	
- 	 The RemoteAdmin interface and its implementation, the AdminService class 
	
	
	The cached router, referred to as the router from now on, improves the responsiveness of the application by caching responses for a given period of time, expiring them as required, and storing new request 
	responses in the cache. It does this by calling the un-cached router, or ncrouter, which forwards the call 
	to the implementing service, the OrderService class. 
	
	
	We will also take a closer look at deploying and un-deploying SOAP services (registration) in a secure 
	environment. Finally, we will conclude the chapter with a look at custom serialization and good 
	practices for SOAP service design. We will test the service with a minimal command line client. 
	
	You might be wondering where the Graphical User Interface (GUI) clients are in this picture. The GUI 
	clients are not part of the SOAP server (they are not Web services) and will be discussed as part of the 
	clients. Per our requirements, which we discussed in the previous chapter, the GUI is browser-based and 
	as such contains two tiers: a server tier that generates the pages and a client tier that displays the pages. In practice, the server tier of the GUI can run on the same server as the SOAP server. The design of the 
	sample application will make switching back and forth between the two solutions a trivial task. 
	
	
	We begin our description of the SOAP server with the architecture of LeSavon.com. 
	
	
	
LeSavon.com Architecture
 
	We took some liberties with the Unified Modeling Language (UML) since we need to represent calls over HTTP in addition to straight method calls. The entry points to the sample application are two 
	servlets: router and ncrouter. The servlets implementing these functions route SOAP traffic. 
	
	
	The com.lesavon.service.Serveur class implements the function of the router. It will check if a 
	response to a request is stored in the cache, and will return it if so. Otherwise, it calls the ncrouter, which will forward the call to the relevant service. 
	
	
	The org.apache.soap.server.http. RPCRouterServlet class provides the function of the 
	ncrouter. We used this class in Chapter 3 with the HelloWorld example. We don't need to amend the implementation provided by apache for this part of the application; it will suffice for our purposes. 
	
	
	The ncrouter will also field administration calls; a client can administer the cache by flushing or refreshing it. 
	In reality, the entry point to LeSavon.com is the Web server that handles authentication. The figure below shows the collaboration diagram between the classes on the server-side for a call to 
	com.lesavon.RemoteOrder.getOrderList(). 
	
	
	
	
	The signature of the RemoteOrder.getOrderList() method that returns the list of orders for a given user: 
public Order[] getOrderList(String userName) throws SavonException;
	
	There are two different flows suggested by the diagram above. Let's review the steps for the first flow 
	described by the previous figure: 
	
	
	1. getOrderList() 
	The client calls getOrderList() using SOAP over HTTP. The target URL for the client 
	in this diagram is the Serveur class. 
	
	
	2. getCacheData() 
	On receiving the request, the router forwards the request to the SOAPCache class that, as 
	its name suggests, implements a cache for SOAP requests. If the cache has the response, 
	then that response can be returned and the client has the list of orders from getOrderList(). 
	If it does not, then it calls the ncrouter class, RPCRouterServlet. 
	3. getOrderList() 
	For this call, the SOAP cache is a client of the ncrouter. When a client does not want to 
	use the cache, it should send requests directly to the ncrouter. We will see how this works 
	in a few moments. 
	
	
	To process the request, RPCRouterServlet parses and validates the SOAP request. The 
	ncrouter goes through its list of registered services to find the target class for the getOrderList() method. In this case, the target is OrderService, which implements 
	
	
	the RemoteService interface. The OrderService then makes JDBC calls to access the 
	data for the list of services. 
	
	
	4. getOrderList() 
	The call to OrderService. getOrderList() is handled as in-process Java, as we saw in 
	Chapter 3 with the HelloWorld service. 
	The call from the cache to the router servlet is made over SOAP. Using SOAP gives us flexibility during 
	deployment: we can deploy the SOAP service on the same machine as the cache or on another 
	machine. However, with flexibility usually comes a trade-off with performance: a call made over SOAP is going to be slower than an in-process call. When the call makes it back to the SOAPCache, the 
	
	
	resulting SOAP response is saved to the cache. Finally, the SOAP response is sent back to the client. 
	A call to a non-cached method is slightly different since it is made directly to the ncrouter servlet, 
	completely bypassing the router servlet. 
	
	
	The calls labeled getCacheDirectory() and getUpdateInterval() are not part of this flow and 
	require some explanation. The SOAP cache runs a background thread designed to refresh and clean up 
	SOAP responses. The thread will query a directory service (in this diagram, LDAP) to get the value of 
	parameters such as the path for the cache on disk, how often responses should be updated, etc. In other 
	words, calls from the SOAP cache to the directory service will happen asynchronously. 
	
	
	We will ignore the issues internal to the development of the SOAP cache in this chapter, and instead 
	focus on the implications of SOAPCache to the design and development of the SOAP server.
