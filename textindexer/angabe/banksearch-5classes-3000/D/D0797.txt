This applet performs domain name server lookups. To 
use this tool: 
 
- Type the host name (www.hoskinson.net, for example) in the field 
 labeled host 
 name. 
 
- Click on the 
 Resolve IP Address 
 button. 
 
 
- The applet will then look up and display that host's IP 
 address. 
This applet 
uses Authenticode technology to run as a trusted applet. Consequently, you 
must use Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 or higher to use it (preferably MSIE 
4.01 or higher for best results).
