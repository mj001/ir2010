This is my mock Exam No 1 based on the Objectives for the Sun Java
Programmers Exam. It was created by Marcus Green
(mail@marcusgreen.co.uk)
and may be freely distributed so long as it is unmodified. Please
email me if you have any corrections or comments, but please read
this document first 
http://www.jchq.net/homepage/getanswers.htm.
If you obtained this exam from some other source please email me
to let me know and check out the latest version at
http://www.jchq.net 
It really does come with answers 
Yes, this is a long document (around 35 pages if you were to print it out), if you cannot see
the answers then you have not got the entire document, try reloading
it untill you can see the answer to Question 60 and the words "End
of document";. The answers contain references to approximately
which objective the question relates to. If you have a query about
any of these questions, please, please include the full answer with
the question.
Why not discuss this exam with other people ?
You can post a message on the discussion forum at
http://www.jchq.net/discus
You could also send me your question but I get heaps of
email and my answer is likely to be slow and terse.
How does this compare with the real thing?
As of 5 Oct 2000 the question format has changed very slightly.
You will now get more questions that include snippets (though the
ratio may be similar to this mock exam). Each question will also tell
you how many of the options you need to pick. You can read more about
these revisions at http://www.jchq.net/faq/ExamUpdate.htm.
You should assume that the real thing will be harder though many
people have told me that they get similar marks in the real thing to
my exams. Take a look at the "how jchq helped me" forum at
http://www.jchq.net/discus
to find how other people find the real exam and this material.
Where can you find other Mock Exams?
Check out my FAQ at http://www.jchq.net/faq/jcertfaq.htm
for links to other mock exams You will find links to many good mock
exams that add up to hundreds of questions. You can check out my
second mock exam that contains 60 question at
http://www.jchq.net/mockexams/exam2.htm
If you think you have found an error:-
Please include which exam you are referring to, ie 1 or 2 (and
maybe soon 3) 
Read the questions carefully
I have tried to make the questions unambiguous (the meaning should
be obvious), but make sure you have read what I have written not what
you think I might have written. Thus if it says "Classes can be
declared with the private modifier ", it means It is possible to
declare a class with the private modifier and not that all classes in
all situations can be declared as private. Each question may have one
or more correct Answers.

Answer 17)
 Back to Question 17) 
Objective
6.2)
3) Runtime Exception 
Without the cast to sub you would get a compile 
 time error. The cast tells the compiler that you really mean to do this and 
 the actual type of b does not get resolved until runtime. Casting down the object 
 hierarchy is a problem, as the compiler cannot be sure what has been implemented in descendent 
 classes. Casting up is not a problem because sub classes will have the features 
 of the base classes. This can feel counter intuitive if you are aware that with 
 primitives casting is allowed for widening operations (ie byte to int).

Answer 18)
Back to question 18) 
Objective
5.1) 
1) System.out.println( -1 >>> 2);will output a result
larger than 10
2) System.out.println( -1 >>> 2); will
output a positive number 
3) System.out.println( 2 >> 1);
will output the number 1 
You can test this with the following class
public class shift{
static int i=2;
public static void main(String argv[]){
 System.out.println( -1 >>> 2);
 System.out.println( -1 >>> 2);
 System.out.println( 2 >> 1);
 }
}
Java does not have a 
 Objective 7.1
2) Output of One One Two Two
Answer 3 would would be true if the code called the start method instead of 
 the run method (well it is on my Windows machine anyway, I'm not sure it would 
 be for ever implementation of Java Threads). If you call the run method directly 
 it just acts as any other method and does not return to the calling code until 
 it has finished executing.

Answer 55)
Objective 3.1) 
Back to Question 55)
1) You cannot be certain when garbage collection will run 
Although there is a Runtime.gc(), this only suggests 
 that the Java Virtual Machine does its garbage collection. You can never be 
 certain when the garbage collector will run. Roberts and Heller is more specific 
 abou this than Boone. This uncertainty can cause consternation for C++ programmers 
 who wish to run finalize methods with the same intent as they use destructor 
 methods.

Answer 56)
Objective 8.1) 
Back to Question 56)
4) The fill field of the GridBagConstraints class 
Unlike the GridLayout manager you can set the individual size of a
control such as a button using the GridBagLayout manager. A little
background knowledge would indicate that it should be controlled by a
setSomethingOrOther method, but it isn't. 
If you have a copy of the Roberts and Heller Java2 Guide that says
the exam does not cover the GridBagLayout, this is an error. You can
confirm this by looking at the online errata at 
http://www.sybex.com/cgi-bin/rd_err_temp.pl?2463err.html.

Answer 57)
Objective 10.1) 
Back to Question 57)
4) A collection for storing bits as on-off information, like a
vector of bits 
This is the description given to a bitset in Bruce 
 Eckels "Thinking in Java" book. The reference to unique sequence of 
 bits was an attempt to mislead because of the use of the word Set in the name 
 bitset. Normally something called a set implies uniqueness of the members, but 
 not in this context.

Answer 58)
Back to Question 58) 
Objective
4.1)
4)Compile error: Superclass Class1.Base of class Class1.Class1 not
found 
Using the package statement has an effect similar 
 to placing a source file into a different directory. Because the files are in 
 different packages they cannot see each other. The stuff about File1 not having 
 been compiled was just to mislead, java has the equivalent of an "automake", 
 whereby if it was not for the package statements the other file would have been 
 automatically compiled.

Answer 59)
Back to Question 59) 
Objective
6.2) 
4) Output of Over.amethod() 
The names of parameters to an overridden method 
 is not important. 
http://www.jchq.net/tutorial/06_02Tut.htm
Answer 60)
Objective 8.1) 
Back to Question 60)
1) Set the gridy value of the GridBagConstraints class to a value increasing 
 from 1 to 4 
Answer 4 is fairly obviously bogus as it is the GridBagConstraints class that 
 does most of the magic in laying out components under the GridBagLayout manager. 
 The fill value of the GridBagConstraints class controls the behavior inside 
 its virtual cell and the ipady field controls the internal padding around a 
 component. 
If you have a copy of the Roberts and Heller Java2 Guide that says
the exam does not cover the GridBagLayout, this is an error. You can
confirm this by looking at the online errata at 
http://www.sybex.com/cgi-bin/rd_err_temp.pl?2463err.html.
