Checkbox 
 
 Checkboxes are actually quite simple. If
you don't know what one is, check out the applet below, and you will isntantly
recognize it. What you may not know is the difference between the square
checkboxes and the round ones. The round ones are part of a CheckboxGroup,
which means that not more than one of them can be selected at a time.
 The square checkboxes could all be clicked,
if you wished it so. They are just normal Checkboxes, and are not part of a
CheckboxGroup. Here are the constructors:
Checkbox objectnamehere=new Checkbox();
Checkbox objectnamehere=new Checkbox("Hello");
Checkbox objectnamehere=new Checkbox("Hello",false);
Checkbox objectnamehere=new Checkbox("Hello",groupname,false);
CheckboxGroup objectnamehere=new CheckboxGroup();
 The first constructor simply
creates a Checkbox. No text. No nothin. Just a Checkbox. If you want it to have
text, you have to use the setLabel() method.
 The second constructor is more useful. It
creates a checkbox with text! You are much more likely to use this one than the
first. The text that you want to appear next to the Checkbox is put in between
the quotes.
 The third constructor is the same as the
second, except the false tells the Checkbox that you don't want it to start off
clicked. This is normally the case, but is a different constructor because you
can put true instead of false, and have the button be automatically
clicked.
 The fourth constructor is a constructor for
a circular checkbox (radio button). In the parentheses, there are three
different things you have to enter. First is the text of the radio button,
which is put in between quotes. After the next comma, you put 
the name of the
CheckboxGroup you want it to be in. The CheckboxGroup already has to be
declared, however. (To declare a CheckboxGroup, use the fifth constructor. It
is very simple.) The third part of the fourth constructor simply sets the state
of the Checkbox. If it is true, the Checkbox is automatically clicked. If it is
false, it is not. Here is the applet to look at!

//this line imports the Applet class so this program can be an applet
import java.applet.Applet;
//this line imports the Graphical User Interface components, including
// checkbox
import java.awt.*;
//this next line begins the program, which is an applet named checkbox
public class checkbox extends Applet{
	//this next line creates a simple checkbox which has the text hello
	Checkbox check1=new Checkbox("Hello");
	//this creates a checkbox named check2 that will have its label set
	//using the setLabel() method
	Checkbox check2=new Checkbox();
	//the next line creates a checkbox named check3 which says checked.
	//The checkbox will automatically be clicked due to the word true
	Checkbox check3=new Checkbox("checked",true);
	//this line will create a Checkbox check4 that will have its state
	// set
	//later on
	Checkbox check4=new Checkbox("setState() Method");
	//the following line of code makes a checkbox group, which will be
	//explained
	CheckboxGroup main=new CheckboxGroup();
	//the next line creates a radio button which will be added to the
	//CheckboxGroup named main
	//in the parentheses, the first part sets the text, the second tells
	//which
	//CheckboxGroup it is going to be a part of, and the third sets the
	//state
	Checkbox check5=new Checkbox("radio button",main,false);
	//same thing as above, just another variable
	Checkbox check6=new Checkbox("radio button2",main,false);
	//the init method is executed when the applet is initialized
	public void init(){
	//this line adds the Checkbox named check1
	add(check1);
	//NOTE---VERY IMPORTANT
	//If you try to use the setLabel() method after you add the
	// checkbox
	//to the applet, it WILL NOT always come out perfectly, as
	// I just
	//saw while typing this code
	//this line sets the label of check2 to setlabel method
	check2.setLabel("setlabel method");
	//this line adds the Checkbox named check2
	add(check2);
	//the next line adds the Checkbox named check3
	add(check3);
	//the next line will set the state of check4 so it is clicked
	check4.setState(true);
	//this next line adds check4 to the applet
	add(check4);
	//the next two lines add check5 and check6, which are radio
	// buttons
	//because they are part of a CheckboxGroup
	add(check5);	
	add(check6);
	}
