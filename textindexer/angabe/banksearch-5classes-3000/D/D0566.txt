Class OrderPage
java.lang.Object
 |
 +--javax.servlet.GenericServlet
 |
 +--javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet
 |
 +--coreservlets.OrderPage
public class OrderPageextends HttpServlet
Shows all items currently in ShoppingCart. Clients
 have their own session that keeps track of which
 ShoppingCart is theirs. If this is their first visit
 to the order page, a new shopping cart is created.
 Usually, people come to this page by way of a page
 showing catalog entries, so this page adds an additional
 item to the shopping cart. But users can also
 bookmark this page, access it from their history list,
 or be sent back to it by clicking on the "Update Order"
 button after changing the number of items ordered.
