	Introducing Java (TM) - Your First Applet	
	
By 
	Diana Luckevich
	
The picture below is a screen shot of an applet that allows you to scroll through a list of names, select one name and press the button to send an email to the selected person. This applet conserves space on the HTML page and provides an interesting 
graphical display.
Click here to run the applet
This article will introduce the Java(TM) programming language through the study of this useful applet. You will learn how a Java enabled browser controls the flow of work in an applet. You will learn how to build a simple
 graphical user interface and how to handle user initiated events like pressing a button. You will learn how to read data into an applet and how to parse this data. You will see how easy it is to invoke the browsers email program from an applet. You will 
be able to put the Contact applet on your Java powered web pages today.
	This article assumes you have programming experience. Java is a good language to use to 
	learn programming. However, teaching you how to program is beyond the scope of this article. 
	You should consider selecting a Java textbook.
