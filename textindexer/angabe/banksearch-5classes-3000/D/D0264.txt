Deploying the Entity Bean
To deploy the entity bean in the Blazix EJB server, add the following lines
to the EJB configuration file ejb.ini.
ejbJar: c:\Ejbtut\PropsEjb.jar
ejb.Props.dataSource: propsDataSource
ejb.Props.table: PropsTable
The first line loads the EJB by specifying the name of the Jar file created
by the EJB compiler. Loading the EJB also registers the name of the
EJB - "Props" in this case - with the EJB server. In the next line
we are specifying the data source associated with the EJB. The data
source is already configured, so we just need to give its name to the EJB
server. We also need to the specify the table name within the data
source.
After having changed the ejb.ini file as shown above, start the Blazix
EJB server. You should see the following lines in the output from
the EJB server showing your EJB was deployed:
Deploying EJB-Home class "props.PropsHome" at JNDI name "Props"
[Note: It is not always necessary to stop and restart the server
to deploy an EJB. In fact, in a production environment this
would not be a good idea. Many EJB containers support "live" deployments
and updates of EJBs. For instance, in Blazix, EJBs can be added or
updated via a "live" deployment using the EJB remote administration tool. 
See your server documentation for details.]
Exercise: Deploy your employee EJB.
