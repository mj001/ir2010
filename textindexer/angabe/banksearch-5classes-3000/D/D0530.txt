 JADCentral (Java Application Developer Central) is a website 
 for the Java community. Java developers submit demos to CodeCentral, 
 post technical questions to the Forums, share opinions on 
 SurveyCentral, and create webpages for their companies in 
 Technology Showcase. Additionally, Java User Groups set up 
 webpages at no-cost to communicate news on upcoming events, 
 helpful links and code, and membership information.
