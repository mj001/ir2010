Rick's 
 Day of Fun With Microsoft's Attorneys
 The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
 Last Thursday I had the dubious luxury of spending the entire 
 day being deposed by attorneys representing Microsoft in Sun's 
 civil antitrust litigation against the monopolist. It was 
 my first time giving a deposition in almost 20 years, and the 
 whole experience was foreign to me. It was videotaped from start 
 to finish, and there was a laptop computer displaying a real-time 
 feed of the court reporter's transcript. more&#133;

 We all know that no matter what you do in business, success usally comes back to your ability to market your products and services. This is true for Java as Microsoft is spending millions of dollars marketing competing products.
There has been a lot of talk on JavaLobby about the marketing of Java, but what about commercial Java products? What are the best ways to today to market Java products. Does anyone care to share any ideas or experiences?

 Java 3D 1.3 Now Available

 The Java3D 1.3 implementation is now available. This represents a major step forward for 3D and Java. This version boasts many performance improvements as well as fixed a number of problems with previous releases (such as atomic behavior updates, etc.) With this release, Java becomes a much more serious platform for game development.

 I cancelled my cable modem service after their tech support and customer service refused to do anything with some relevant sercurity information I provided them about probes/scans coming from IP addresses within their network.
This information was gleaned from www logs on some web servers I managed at the time. 
Given the very real threat of cyberattacks; consumers and businesses need to strive for zero tolerance for these kind of activities (probes/scans/etc). 
It shouldn't matter which flavor of the minute microsoft Outbreak or Internet Exploder virus the customer with a cable modem has and doesn't know or care to patch; if their machine is being used to attack other targets accross the net - I say CUT THEM OFF!

 How does a software development team become truly proficient at developing component based reusable code? Beyond the challenge of learning the technology is the challenge of the proper application of methodology as well. Can a software team that is just getting started truly mature by primarily focusing only on one of the two?

 Dear JavaLobby memebers - I need your help!

 I'm working as a web developer in a large company (about a thousand workers).
Every now and then, there is a technological lecture about a specific topic.
Many of the company's workers are present. These workers may be developers, marketing people, project managers,
graphic designers, DBAs - you name it.
In a few weeks, another such lecture will take place.
This time, it is going to be a dual between .NET and J2EE.
It is often cited in the JavaLobby community that we, the members, should take active promotion
of the Java platform. I believe this lecture/dual, is a valuable oppurtunity to promote Java.
And this is where I need your help, dear JavaLobby members.

 BEA WebLogic Bible

 The Weblogic Bible is an enjoyable read. If you have been using WebLogic off and on since before EJB existed, you will still learn a bunch of new tricks. 
This is an excellent reference that can be read from cover to cover. The book focuses on small examples with an emphasis of deploying and configuring the examples in the WebLogic environment. 
Their are plenty of examples of setting up the configuration with an explanations of what the different parameters are and when to use them for Servlets, JSP, EJB, JMS, and more; just what you need when you are having those configuration problems and a great reference to have around when you get stuck. If you like going from concept to implementation, then this is the book for you.

 Two recent studies are showing that Java will become the dominant language in corporations next year. 
http://www.sdtimes.com/news/057/story7.htm
"48.8 percent of respondents indicated that they are currently developing apps for either Java 2 Standard Edition or Java 2 Enterprise Edition, and 51.8 percent said that they expect to be building new apps for J2SE or J2EE within the next year."
and

"J2EE has been widely adopted, with an annual market growth rate of around 40%"
